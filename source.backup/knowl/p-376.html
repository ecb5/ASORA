<p>Notable enough, however are the controversies over the series <span class="process-math">\(1-1+1-1+etc\text{,}\)</span>  whose sum was given by Leibniz as <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\text{,}\)</span> although others disagree . . . Understanding of this question is to be sought in the word “sum;” this idea, if thus conceived - namely, the sum of a series is said to be that quantity to which it is brought closer as more terms of a series are taken - has relevance only for the convergent series, and we should in general give up this idea of sum for divergent series. On the other hand, as series in analysis arise from the expansion of fractions or irrational quantities or even of transcendentals, it will, in turn, be permissible in calculation to substitute in place of such series that quantity out of whose development it is produced.</p>
