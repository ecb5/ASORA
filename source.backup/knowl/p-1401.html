<p>If we consider <span class="process-math">\((0,1]\text{,}\)</span> which has the same cardinality as <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{,}\)</span> then we can see that this has the same cardinality as <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> as well. Specifically, if we think of the numbers in binary, then every real number in <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span> can be written as <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{a_j}{2^j} =0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a_j\in\left\{0,1\right\}\text{.}\)</span> We have to account for the fact that binary representations such as <span class="process-math">\(0.0111\ldots\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(0.1000\ldots\)</span> represent the same real number (say that no representations will end in an infinite string of zeros), then we can see that <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span> has the same cardinality as <span class="process-math">\(T-U\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is the set of all sequences ending in an infinite string of zeros. It turns out that <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> itself is a countable set.</p>
