<p>Fortunately, the answer to that question is no. Power series are generally much more well-behaved than Fourier series. Whenever a power series converges, the function it converges to will be continuous. As long as one stays inside the interval of convergence, power series can be differentiated and integrated term-by-term. Power series have something going for them that your average Fourier series does not. (We need to develop the machinery to know what that something is.) None of this is any more obvious to us than it was to mathematicians at the beginning of the nineteenth century. What they did know was that relying on intuition was perilous and rigorous formulations were needed to either justify or dismiss these intuitions. In some sense, the nineteenth century was the “morning after” the mathematical party that went on throughout the eighteenth century.</p>
