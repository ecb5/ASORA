<p>The bisection method we employed in the proof of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_SqrtsExist.html" title="Theorem 10.1.6">Theorem 10.1.6</a> is pretty typical of how we will use the NIP, as taking midpoints ensures that we will create a sequence of “nested intervals.” We will employ this strategy in the proofs of the IVT and EVT. Deciding how to relabel the endpoints of our intervals will be determined by what we want to do with these two sequences of real numbers. This will typically lead to a fifth property, which will be crucial in proving that the <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> guaranteed by the NIP does what we want it to do. Specifically, in the above example, we always wanted our candidate for <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{a}\)</span> to be in the interval <span class="process-math">\([\,x_n,y_n]\text{.}\)</span> This judicious choice led to the extra Property 5: <span class="process-math">\(\forall\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(n,\,x_n^2\leq a\leq y_n^2\text{.}\)</span> In applying the NIP to prove the IVT and EVT, we will find that properties 1-4 will stay the same. Property 5 is what will change based on the property we want <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> to have.</p>
