<p>Notice that this agrees with the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f^\prime\text{,}\)</span> except that <span class="process-math">\(f^\prime\)</span> didn't exist at <span class="process-math">\(x=\frac{1}{2}\text{,}\)</span> and this series takes on the value <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=\frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</span> Notice also, that every partial sum of this series is continuous, since it is a finite combination of continuous cosine functions. This agrees with what you learned in calculus, the (finite) sum of continuous functions is always continuous. In the 1700's, this was also assumed to be true for infinite series, because every time a power series converged to a function, that function happened to be continuous. This never failed for power series, so this example was a bit disconcerting as it is an example of the sum of <em class="emphasis">infinitely many</em> continuous functions which is, in this case, discontinuous. Was it possible that there was some power series which converged to a function which was not continuous? Even if there wasn't, what was the difference between power series and this Fourier series?</p>
