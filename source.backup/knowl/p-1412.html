<p>If you look back at the proof of Cantor's Theorem, this was basically the idea that gave us the contradiction.  To have such a contradiction occurring at the most basic level of mathematics was scandalous.  It forced a number of mathematicians and logicians to carefully devise the axioms by which sets could be constructed. To be honest, most mathematicians still approach set theory from a naive point of view as the sets we typically deal with fall under the category of what we would call “normal sets.” In fact, such an approach is officially called Naive Set Theory (as opposed to Axiomatic Set Theory).  However, attempts to put set theory and logic on solid footing led to the modern study of symbolic logic and ultimately the design of computer (machine) logic.</p>
