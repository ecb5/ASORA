<p>So, at this point we will simply assume the existence of the real numbers. We will assume also that they have all of the properties that we are used to. This is perfectly acceptable as long as we make our assumptions explicit. However we need to be aware that, so far, the existence and properties of the real numbers is an <em class="emphasis">assumption</em> that has not been logically derived. Any time we make an assumption we need to be prepared to either abandon it completely if we find that it leads to nonsensical results, or to re-examine the assumption in the light of these results to see if we can find another assumption that subsumes the first and explains the (apparently) nonsensical results.</p>
