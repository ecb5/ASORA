<p>The difficulty is quite delicate and it took mathematicians a while to determine the problem. There are two very subtly different ways that a sequence of functions can converge: pointwise or uniformly. This  distinction was touched upon by Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) in 1826 while studying the domain of convergence of a power series. However, the necessary formal definitions were not made explicit until Weierstrass  did it in his 1841 paper <i class="foreign">Zur Theorie der Potenzreihen</i> <em class="emphasis">(On the Theory of Power Series)</em>. This was published in his collected works in 1894.</p>
