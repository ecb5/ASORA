<p>Newton explicitly founded his version of calculus on the assumption that we can think of variable quantities as being generated by a continuous motion. If our number system has holes in it such continuous motion is impossible because we have no way to jump over the gaps. So Newton simply postulated that there were no holes. He filled in the hole where <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> should be. He simply said, yes there is a number there called <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> and he did the same with all of the other holes.</p>
