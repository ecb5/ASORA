<p>As was indicated before, Cantor's  work on infinite sets had a profound impact on mathematics in the beginning of the twentieth century. For example, in examining the proof of Cantor's Theorem, the eminent logician Bertrand Russell devised his famous paradox in 1901. Before this time, a set was naively thought of as just a collection of objects. Through the work of Cantor and others, sets were becoming a central object of study in mathematics as many mathematical concepts were being reformulated in terms of sets. The idea was that set theory was to be a unifying theme of mathematics. This paradox set the mathematical world on its ear.</p>
