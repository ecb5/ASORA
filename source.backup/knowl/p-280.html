<p>Notice that since <span class="process-math">\(1/2\)</span> is not an integer the series no longer terminates. Although Newton did not prove that this series was correct (nor did we), he tested it by multiplying the series by itself. When he saw that by squaring the series he started to obtain <span class="process-math">\(1+x+0\,x^2+0\,x^3+\cdots\text{,}\)</span> he was convinced that the series was exactly equal to <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{1+x}\text{.}\)</span></p>
