<p>This function went against Euler's notion of what a continuous function should be.  Here, an infinite sum of continuous cosine curves provided a single expression which resulted in a “discontinuous” curve.  But as we've seen this didn't happen with power series and an intuitive notion of continuity is inadequate to explain the difference.  Even more perplexing is the following situation.  Intuitively, one would think that a continuous curve should have a tangent line at at least one point.  It may have a number of jagged points to it, but it should be “smooth” somewhere.  An example of this would be <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^{2/3}\text{.}\)</span>  Its graph is given by</p>
