<p>Making <span class="process-math">\(\big|a_n\big|\big|b_n-b\big|\lt \frac{\eps}{2}\)</span> requires a bit more finesse. At first glance, one would be tempted to try and make <span class="process-math">\(\big|b_n-b\big|\lt \frac{\eps}{2|a_n|}\text{.}\)</span> Even if we ignore the fact that we could be dividing by zero (which we could handle), we have a bigger problem. According to the definition of <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}b_n=b\text{,}\)</span> we can make <span class="process-math">\(\big|b_n-b\big|\)</span> smaller than any given fixed positive number, as long as we make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> large enough (larger than some <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> which goes with a given epsilon). Unfortunately, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\eps}{2|a_n|}\)</span> is not fixed as it has the variable <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in it; there is no reason to believe that a single <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> will work with all of these simultaneously. To handle this impasse, we need the following:</p>
