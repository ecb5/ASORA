<p>Sometimes the <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> that will work for a particular <span class="process-math">\(\eps\)</span> is fairly obvious to see, especially after you've gained some experience.  This is the case in the above examples (at least after looking back at the proofs).  However, the task of finding a <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> to work is usually not so obvious and requires some scrapwork.  This scrapwork is vital toward producing a <span class="process-math">\(\delta\text{,}\)</span> but again is not part of the polished proof.  This can be seen in the following example.</p>
