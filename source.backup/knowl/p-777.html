<p>Bear in mind that someone reading the formal proof will not have seen the scrapwork, so the choice of <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> might seem rather mysterious.  However, you are in no way bound to motivate this choice of <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> and usually you should not, unless it is necessary for the formal proof.  All you have to do is find this <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> and show that it works.  Furthermore, to a trained reader, your ideas will come through when you demonstrate that your choice of <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> works.</p>
