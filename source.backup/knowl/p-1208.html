<p>The converse of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cor_AbsConv-_Conv.html" title="Corollary 11.2.27">Corollary 11.2.27</a> is not true as evidenced by the series <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}\text{.}\)</span> As we noted in <a href="PowerSeriesQuestions.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: Questions Concerning Power Series">Chapter 5</a>, this series converges to ln <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> However, its absolute series is the Harmonic  Series which diverges. Any such series which converges, but not absolutely, is said to <em class="alert">converge conditionally</em>. Recall also that in <a href="PowerSeriesQuestions.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: Questions Concerning Power Series">Chapter 5</a>, we showed that we could rearrange the terms of the series <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}\)</span> to make it converge to any number we wished. We noted further that all rearrangements of the series <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{\left(n+1\right)^2}\)</span> converged to the same value. The difference between the two series is that the latter converges absolutely whereas the former does not. Specifically, we have the following result.</p>
