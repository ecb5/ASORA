<p>Remember that when these rigorous formulations were developed, intuitive notions of convergence were already in place and had been used with great success. This definition was developed to address the foundational issues. Could our intuitions be verified in a concrete fashion that was above reproach? This was the purpose of this non-intuitive definition. It was to be used to verify that our intuition was, in fact, correct and do so in a very prescribed manner. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(b&gt;0\)</span> is a fixed number, then you would probably say as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> approaches infinity, <span class="process-math">\(b^{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)}\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(b^0=1\text{.}\)</span> After all, we did already prove that <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}=0\text{.}\)</span> We should be able to back up this intuition with our rigorous definition.</p>
