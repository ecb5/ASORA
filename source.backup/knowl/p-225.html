<p> Applied to polynomials, the rules of differential and integral calculus are straightforward.  Indeed, differentiating and integrating polynomials represent some of the easiest tasks in a calculus course.  For example, computing <span class="process-math">\(\int(7-x+x^2)\dx{ x}\)</span> is relatively easy compared to computing <span class="process-math">\(\int\sqrt[3]{1+x^3}\dx{ x}\text{.}\)</span>  Unfortunately, not all functions can be expressed as a polynomial.  For example, <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\sin x\)</span> cannot be since a polynomial has only finitely many roots and the sine function has infinitely many roots, namely <span class="process-math">\(\{n\pi|\,n\in\ZZ\}\text{.}\)</span>  A standard technique in the 18th century was to write such functions as an “infinite polynomial,” what we typically refer to as a power series.  Unfortunately an “infinite polynomial” is a much more subtle object than a mere polynomial, which by definition is finite. For now we will not concern ourselves with these subtleties.  We will follow the example of our forebears and manipulate all “polynomial-like” objects (finite or infinite) as if they are polynomials.</p>
