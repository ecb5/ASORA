<p>Keep this in mind as you proceed through this course and your mathematical education. Every problem you solve is really a theorem, a potential tool that you can use later. We have chosen the problems in this text deliberately with this in mind. Don't just solve the problems and move on. Just because you have solved a problem does not mean you should stop thinking about it. Keep thinking about the problems you've solved. Internalize them. Make the ideas your own so that when you need them later you will have them at hand to use.</p>
