<p>It wasn't explicitly stated in the definition but when we say “if <span class="process-math">\(\abs{x-a}\lt \delta\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(|f(x)-f(a)|\lt
\eps\text{,}\)</span>” we should be restricting ourselves to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> values which are in the domain of the function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> otherwise <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> doesn't make sense.  We didn't put it in the definition because that definition was complicated enough without this technicality.  Also in the above examples, the functions were defined everywhere so this was a moot point.  We will continue with the convention that when we say “if <span class="process-math">\(|\,x-a|\lt \delta\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(|f(x)-f(a)|\lt \eps\text{,}\)</span>” we will be restricting ourselves to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> values which are in the domain of the function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span>  This will allow us to examine continuity of functions not defined for all <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> without restating this restriction each time.</p>
