  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we have seen, when they converge,
      power series are very well behaved and Fourier (trigonometric) series are not necessarily.
      The fact that trigonometric series were so interesting made them a lightning rod for mathematical study in the late nineteenth century.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, consider the question of uniqueness.
      We saw in <xref ref="TaylorSeries">Chapter</xref>
      that if a function could be represented by a power series,
      then that series must be the Taylor series.
      More precisely, if
      <me>
        f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x-a)^n, \text{  then  }  a_n=\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what can be said about the uniqueness of a trigonometric series?
      If we can represent a function <m>f</m> as a general trigonometric series
      <me>
        f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x\,+b_n\sin n\pi x)
      </me>,
      then must this be the Fourier series with the coefficients as determined by Fourier?
          <idx><h>Fourier, Jean Baptiste Joseph</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p>
      For example,
      if <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x\,+b_n\sin n\pi x)</m> converges to <m>f</m> uniformly on the interval <m>(0,1)</m>,
      then because of the uniform convergence, Fourier's term-by-term integration which we saw in <xref ref="Interregnum">Part</xref>
      is perfectly legitimate and the coefficients are,
      of necessity, the coefficients he computed.
      However we have seen that the convergence of a Fourier series need not be uniform.
      This does not mean that we cannot integrate term-by-term,
      but it does say that we can't be sure that term-by-term integration of a Fourier series will yield the integral of the associated function.
    </p>

    <p>
          <idx><h>Lebesgue, Henri</h></idx> 
          <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx> 
          This led to a generalization of the integral by Henri
          Lebesgue in 1905.  Lebesgue's profound work settled the
          issue of whether or not a bounded pointwise converging
          trigonometric series is the Fourier series of a function,
          but we will not go in this direction.  We will instead focus
          on work that Georg Cantor (1845-1918) did in the years just prior.
          Cantor's work was also profound and had far reaching
          implications in modern mathematics.  It also leads to some
          very weird conclusions.
    </p>
<aside><p> 'Weird' does not mean false.  It
          simply means that some of Cantor's results can be hard to
          accept, even after you have seen the proof and verified its
          validity.</p>
      </aside> 


    <p>
      To begin, let's suppress the underlying function and suppose we have
      <me>
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x\,+b_n\sin n\pi x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a^\prime_n\cos n\pi x\,+b^\prime_n\sin n\pi x)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We ask: If these two series are equal must it be true that <m>a_n=a^\prime_n</m> and
      <m>b_n=b^\prime_n?</m> We can reformulate this uniqueness question as follows: Suppose
      <me>
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty\left((a_n-a^\prime_n)\cos n\pi x\,+(b_n-b^\prime_n)\sin n\pi x\right) = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we let <m>c_n = a_n-a^\prime_n</m> and <m>d_n = b_n-b^\prime_n</m>,
      then the question becomes: If <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(c_n\cos n\pi x\,+d_n\sin n\pi x\right) = 0</m>,
      then will <m>c_n=d_n=0?</m> It certainly seems reasonable to suppose so,
      but at this point we have enough experience with infinite sums to know that we need to be <em>very</em>
      careful about relying on the intuition we have honed on finite sums.

          <h>Cantor, Georg</h>
           <h>and the modern view of mathematics</h>
      </idx>
      The answer to this seemingly basic question leads to some very
      profound results.  In particular, answering this question led
      the mathematician  Cantor  to study the makeup
      of the real number system.  This in turn opened the door to the
      modern view of mathematics of the twentieth century.  In
      particular, Cantor proved the following result in 1871<nbsp
      />(<xref ref="jahnke03__histor_analy"/>, p. 305).

    </theorem>

    <p>
      In his attempts to nail down precisely which <q>certain values</q>
      could be exceptional, Cantor was led to examine the nature of subsets of real numbers and ultimately to give a precise definition of the concept of infinite sets and to define an arithmetic of
      <q>infinite numbers.</q>

<aside><title>
Transfinite Numbers

<p> Actually,
      he called them <em>transfinite numbers</em> because,
      by definition, numbers are finite.</p>

    <p>
      As a first step toward identifying those
      <q>certain values,</q> Cantor 
      proved the following theorem,
      which we will state but not prove.

    <p>
      Observe that this is not a trivial generalization.
      Although the exceptional points are constrained to be finite in number,
      this number could still be extraordinarily large.
      That is, even if the series given above differed from zero on
      <m>10^{10^{100000}}</m> distinct points in the interval
      <m>(0, 10^{-10^{100000}})</m> the coefficients still vanish.
      This remains true even if at each of these
      <m>10^{10^{100000}}</m> points the series converges to <m>10^{10^{100000}}</m>.
      This is truly remarkable when you think of it this way.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point Cantor became more interested in these exceptional points than in the Fourier series problem that he'd started with.
      The next task he set for himself was to see just how general the set of exceptional points could be.
      Following Cantor's lead we make the following definitions.

          Let <m>S\subseteq \RR</m> and let <m>a</m> be a real number.
          We say that <m>a</m> is a <term>limit point</term>
          (or an <term>accumulation point</term>)
          of <m>S</m> if there is a sequence <m>(a_n)</m> with
          <m>a_n\in S-\left\{a\right\}</m> which converges to <m>a</m>.

          Let <m>S\subseteq\RR</m> and let <m>a</m> be a real number.
          Prove that <m>a</m> is a limit point of <m>S</m> if and only if for every <m>\eps>0</m> the intersection
          <me>
            (a-\eps, a+\eps) \cap S-\left\{a\right\} \neq \emptyset.{}

    The following theorem follows directly from our previous work with the NIP and will be very handy later.

    Our next theorem says that in a certain, very technical sense
    there are more real numbers than there are counting numbers <xref
    ref="franks10__cantor_other_proof_rr_uncoun" />. This probably
    does not seem terribly significant.  After all, there are real
    numbers which are not counting numbers.  What will make this so
    startling is that the same cannot be said about all sets which
    strictly contain the counting numbers.  We will get into the
    details of this after the theorem is proved.

        we are letting <m>S</m> denote both the sequence (which is
        ordered) and the underlying (unordered) set of entries in the
        sequence.</p>  </aside>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      For the sake of obtaining a contradiction assume that the sequence <m>S</m> contains every real number;
      that is, <m>S=\RR</m>.
      As usual we will build a sequence of nested intervals <m>\left(\left[x_i, y_i\right]\right)_{i=1}^\infty</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>x_1</m> be the smaller of the first two distinct elements of <m>S</m>,
      let <m>y_1</m> be the larger and take
      <m>\left[x_1,y_1\right]</m> to be the first interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next we assume that <m>\left[x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right]</m> has been constructed and build <m>\left[x_n, y_n\right]</m> as follows.
      Observe that there are infinitely many elements of <m>S</m> in <m>\left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right)</m> since <m>S=\RR</m>.
      Let <m>s_m</m> and <m>s_k</m> be the <em>first</em>
      two distinct elements of <m>S</m> such that
      <me>
        s_m, s_k \in \left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right) 
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take <m>x_n</m> to be the smaller and <m>y_n</m> to be the larger of <m>s_m</m> and <m>s_k</m>.
      Then <m>\left[x_n, y_n\right]</m> is the <m>n</m>th interval.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the way we constructed them it is clear that
      <me>
        \left[x_1, y_1\right] \supseteq \left[x_2, y_2\right] \supseteq \left[x_3, y_3\right] \supseteq \ldots
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore by <xref ref="thm_WeakNIP">Theorem</xref>
      there is a real number, say <m>c</m>, such that
      <me>
        c\in\left[x_n, y_n\right] \text{ for all }  n\in\NN
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, since <m>x_1\lt x_2\lt x_3\ldots\lt y_3\lt y_2\lt y_1</m> it is clear that
      <men xml:id="eq_NIP-interval">
        x_n\lt c\lt y_n, \ \forall n
      </men>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will show that <m>c</m> is the number we seek.
      That the inequalities in <xref ref="eq_NIP-interval">formula</xref>
      are strict will play a crucial role.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see that <m>c\not\in S</m> we suppose that <m>c\in S</m> and derive a contradiction.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, suppose that <m>c=s_p</m> for some <m>p\in\NN</m>.
      Then only <m>\left\{s_1, s_2,\ldots,
      s_{p-1}\right\}</m> appear before <m>s_p</m> in the sequence <m>S</m>.
      Since each <m>x_n</m> is taken from <m>S</m> it follows that only finitely many elements of the sequence <m>(x_n)</m> appear before <m>s_p=c</m> in the sequence as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>x_l</m> be the <em>last</em>
      element of <m>(x_n)</m> which appears before <m>c=s_p</m> in the sequence and consider <m>x_{l+1}</m>.
      The way it was constructed,
      <m>x_{l+1}</m> was one of the first two distinct terms in the sequence <m>S</m> strictly between <m>x_l</m> and <m>y_l</m>,
      the other being <m>y_{l+1}</m>.
      Since <m>x_{l+1}</m> does not appear before <m>c=s_p</m> in the sequence and <m>x_l\lt c\lt y_l</m>,
      it follows that either <m>c=x_{l+1}</m> or <m>c=y_{l+1}</m>.
      However, this gives us a contradiction as we know from <xref ref="eq_NIP-interval">formula</xref>
      that <m>x_{l+1}\lt c\lt y_{l+1}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus <m>c</m> is not an element of <m>S</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    So how does this theorem show that there are <q>more</q>
    real numbers than counting numbers?
    Before we address that question we need to be very careful about the meaning of the word 'more' when we're talking about infinite sets.
  </p>

  <p>
    First let's consider two finite sets,
    say <m>A=\left\{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta\right\}</m> and <m>B=\left\{a,b,c,d,e\right\}</m>.
    How do we know that <m>B</m> is the bigger set? (It obviously is.) Clearly we can just count the number of elements in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
    Since <m>\abs{A}=4</m> and
    <m>\abs{B}=5</m> and <m>4\lt 5</m> <m>B</m> is clearly bigger.
    But we're looking for a way to determine the relative size of two sets without counting them because we have no way of counting the number of elements of an infinite set.
    Indeed, it isn't even clear what the phrase
    <q>the number of elements</q> might <em>mean</em>
    when applied to the elements of an infinite set.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we count the number of elements in a finite set what we're really doing is matching up the elements of the set with a set of consecutive positive integers,
    starting at <m>1</m>.
    Thus since
    <md>
      <mrow>1\amp \leftrightarrow\alpha</mrow>
      <mrow>2\amp \leftrightarrow\beta</mrow>
      <mrow>3\amp \leftrightarrow\gamma</mrow>
      <mrow>4\amp \leftrightarrow\delta</mrow>
    </md>
    we see that <m>\abs{A}=4</m>.
    Moreover, the order of the match-up is unimportant.
    Thus since
    <md>
      <mrow>2\amp \leftrightarrow e</mrow>
      <mrow>3\amp \leftrightarrow a</mrow>
      <mrow>5\amp \leftrightarrow b</mrow>
      <mrow>4\amp \leftrightarrow d</mrow>
      <mrow>1\amp \leftrightarrow c</mrow>
    </md>
    it is clear that the elements of <m>B</m> and the set
    <m>\left\{1,2,3,4,5\right\}</m> can be matched up as well.
    And it doesn't matter what order either set is in.
    They both have <m>5</m> elements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Such a match-up is called a one-to-one correspondence.
    In general, if two sets can be put in one-to-one correspondence then they are the same <q>size.</q>
    Of course the word <q>size</q>
    has lots of connotations that will begin to get in the way when we talk about infinite sets,
    so instead we will say that the two sets have the same
    <em>cardinality.</em> Speaking loosely,
    this just means that they are the same size.
  </p>

  <p>
    More precisely,
    if a given set <m>S</m> can be put in one-to-one correspondence with a finite set of consecutive integers,
    say <m>\left\{1,2,3,\ldots, N\right\}</m>,
    then we say that the cardinality of the set is <m>N</m>.
    But this just means that both sets have the same cardinality.
    It is this notion of one-to-one correspondence,
    along with the next two definitions,
    which will allow us to compare the sizes (cardinalities) of infinite sets.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_CountableSets">
    <statement>
      <p>
            <idx><h>cardinality</h><h>countable sets</h></idx>
            <idx><h>countable sets</h><h>defintion of</h></idx>
        Any set which can be put into one-to-one correspondence with
        <m>\NN=\left\{1,2,3,\ldots\right\}</m> is called a <term>countably infinite</term> set.
        Any set which is either finite or countably infinite is said to be <term>countable</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Since <m>\NN</m> is an infinite set,
    we have no symbol to designate its cardinality so we have to invent one.
    The symbol used by Cantor 
        <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx>
    and adopted by mathematicians ever since is <m>\aleph_0</m>.
Thus the cardinality of any countably infinite set is <m>\aleph_0</m>.
  </p>
<aside>
<p>
    <m>\aleph{}</m> is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and is pronounced "aleph."
    <m>\aleph_0</m> is pronounced "aleph null."</p>
    </aside> 

  <p>
    We have already given the following definition informally.
    We include it formally here for later reference.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_EqualCardinality">
    <statement>
      <p>
            <idx><h>cardinality</h><h>equal cardinality</h></idx>
            If two sets can be put into one-to-one correspondence then they are said to have the <alert>same cardinality</alert>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    With these two definitions in place we can see that <xref ref="thm_NoSeriesContainsAllReals">Theorem</xref>
    is nothing less than the statement that the real numbers are not countably infinite.
    Since it is certainly not finite,
    then we say that the set of real numbers is uncountable and therefore <q>bigger</q>
    than the natural numbers!
  </p>

  <p>
    To see this let us suppose first that each real number appears in the sequence <m>(s_n)_{n=1}^\infty</m> exactly once.
    In that case the indexing of our sequence is really just a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the sequence and <m>\NN:</m>
    <md>
      <mrow>1\amp \leftrightarrow s_1</mrow>
      <mrow>2\amp \leftrightarrow s_2</mrow>
      <mrow>3\amp \leftrightarrow s_3</mrow>
      <mrow>4\amp \leftrightarrow s_4</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp \ \ \ \vdots</mrow>
    </md>
  </p>

  <p>
    If some real numbers are repeated in our sequence then all of the real numbers are a subset of our sequence and will therefore also be countable
    (see <xref ref="prob_countable_sets_unions_of">Problem</xref>, part a).
  </p>

  <p>
    In either case, every sequence is countable.
    But our theorem says that <em>no</em>
    sequence in <m>\RR</m> includes all of <m>\RR</m>.
    Therefore <m>\RR</m> is uncountable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of the sets you have encountered so far in your life have been countable.

    It seems that no matter what we do the only example of an
    uncountably infinite set is <m>\RR</m>.  But wait!  Remember the
    rational numbers?  They were similar to the real numbers in many
    ways.  Perhaps they are uncountably infinite too?

    Alas, no.

    The following corollary says that the cardinality of the real numbers is <em>much</em>
    larger than the cardinality of the rational numbers,
    despite the fact that both are infinite.
  </p>

  <p>
    That is, as a subset of the reals,
    the rationals can be contained in a sequence of intervals,
    the sum of whose lengths can be arbitrarily small.
    In a sense this says that a countably infinite set is so small

  <p>
    Notice how this idea hearkens back to the discussion of Leibniz's<idx><h>Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm</h></idx> approach to the Product Rule (<xref ref="eq_LeibnizProductRule">equation</xref>).
    He simply tossed aside the expression
    <m>\dx{ x}\dx{ y}</m> because it was <em>infinitely small</em> compared to either <m>x\dx{ y}</m> or <m>y\dx{ x}</m>.
    Although this isn't quite the same thing we are discussing here it is similar and it is clear that Leibniz's insight and intuition were extremely acute.
    They were moving him in the right direction, at least.

  <p>
    All of our efforts to build an uncountable set from a countable one have come to nothing.
    In fact many sets that at first <q>feel</q>
    like they should be uncountable are in fact countable. This makes the uncountability of <m>\RR</m> all the more remarkable.
  </p>
<aside>
<p>    
The failure is in the methods we've used so far.  It is possible to
build an uncountable set using just two symbols if we're clever
enough, but this would take us too far away from our main topic.</p>

    Once Cantor showed that there were two types of infinity
    (countable and uncountable), the following question was natural,
    <q>Do all uncountable sets have the same cardinality?</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    Just like not all <q>non-dogs</q>
    are cats, there is, offhand,
    no reason to believe that all uncountable sets should be the same size.
    However constructing uncountable sets of different sizes is not as easy as it sounds.

        <h>Cantor, Georg</h>
         <h>unit interval and unit square have equal cardinalty</h>
    </idx>
    For example, what about the line segment represented by the
    interval <m>[0,1]</m> and the square represented by the set
    <m>[0,1]\times[0,1]=\left\{(x,y)|0\leq x,y\leq 1\right\}</m>.
    Certainly the two dimensional square must be a larger infinite set
    than the one dimensional line segment.  Remarkably, Cantor showed
    that these two sets were the same cardinality.  In his 1877
    correspondence of this result to his friend and fellow
    mathematician, Richard Dedekind, even Cantor remarked, <q>I see
    it, but I don't believe it!</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    The following gives the original idea of Cantor's proof.
    Cantor devised the following function <m>f:[0,1]\times[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]</m>.
    First, we represent the coordinates of any point
    <m>(x,y)\in [0,1]\times[0,1]</m> by their decimal representations
    <m>x=0.a_1 a_2 a_3\ldots</m> and <m>y=0.b_1 b_2 b_3\ldots</m>.
    Even terminating decimals can be written this way as we could write <m>0.5=0.5000\ldots</m>.
    We can then define <m>f(x,y)</m> by
    <me>
      f((0.a_1 a_2 a_3\ldots ,0.b_1 b_2 b_3\ldots))=0.a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 a_3 b_3\ldots
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This relatively simple idea has some technical difficulties in it related to the following result.
  </p>

  <problem>
    <statement>
      <p>
            <idx><h>series</h><h>Geometric series</h><h><m>(0.\bar{9})</m> converges to <m>1</m></h></idx>
        Consider the sequence <m>(0.9,0.99,0.999,\ldots)</m>.
        Determine that this sequence converges and,
        in fact, it converges to <m>1</m>.
        This suggests that <m>0.999\ldots=1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    Similarly, we have <m>0.04999\ldots=0.05000\ldots</m>, etc.
    To make the decimal representation of a real number in <m>[0,1]</m> unique,
    we must make a consistent choice of writing a terminating decimal as one that ends in an infinite string of zeros or an infinite string of nines [with the one exception
    <m>0=0.000\ldots</m> ]. No matter which choice we make,
    we could never make this function onto.
    For example,
    <m>109/1100=0.09909090\ldots</m> would have as its pre-image
    <m>(0.0999\ldots,0.9000\ldots)</m> which would be a mix of the two conventions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cantor was able to overcome this technicality to demonstrate a one
    to one correspondence, but instead we will note that in either
    convention, the function is one-to-one, so this says that the set
    <m>[0,1]\times[0,1]</m> is the same cardinality as some
    (uncountable) subset of <m>\RR</m>.  The fact that this has the
    same cardinality as <m>\RR</m> is something we will come back to.
    But first we'll try construct an uncountable set which does not
    have the same cardinality as <m>\RR</m>.  To address this issue,
    Cantor proved the following in 1891.

  <p>
    Since <m>S</m> can be put into one-to-one correspondence with a subset of <m>P(S)</m> (<m>a\rightarrow \left\{a\right\}</m>),
    then this says that <m>P(S)</m> is at least as large as S. In the finite case
    <m>\abs{P(S)}</m> is strictly greater than <m>\abs{S}</m> as the following problem shows.

    Actually it turns out that <m>\RR</m> and <m>P(\NN)</m> have the same cardinality.
    This can be seen in a roundabout way using some of the above ideas from <xref ref="prob_PowerSet">Problem</xref>.
    Specifically,
    let <m>T</m> be the set of all sequences of zeros or ones
    (you can use <m>Y</m>s or <m>N</m>s, if you prefer).
    Then it is straightforward to see that <m>T</m> and <m>P(\NN)</m> have the same cardinality.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we consider <m>(0,1]</m>, which has the same cardinality as <m>\RR</m>,
    then we can see that this has the same cardinality as <m>T</m> as well.
    Specifically, if we think of the numbers in binary,
    then every real number in <m>[0,1]</m> can be written as
    <m>\sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{a_j}{2^j} =0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots</m> where <m>a_j\in\left\{0,1\right\}</m>.
    We have to account for the fact that binary representations such as <m>0.0111\ldots</m> and
    <m>0.1000\ldots</m> represent the same real number
    (say that no representations will end in an infinite string of zeros),
    then we can see that <m>[0,1]</m> has the same cardinality as <m>T-U</m>,
    where <m>U</m> is the set of all sequences ending in an infinite string of zeros.
    It turns out that <m>U</m> itself is a countable set.

  <p>
    As we indicated before, Cantor's 
        <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx>
    work on infinite sets had a profound impact on mathematics in the beginning of the twentieth century.
    For example, in examining the proof of Cantor's Theorem,
    the eminent logician Bertrand Russell devised his famous paradox in 1901.
    Before this time,
    a set was naively thought of as just a collection of objects.
    Through the work of Cantor and others,
    sets were becoming a central object of study in mathematics as many mathematical concepts were being reformulated in terms of sets.
    The idea was that set theory was to be a unifying theme of mathematics.
    This paradox set the mathematical world on its ear.
  </p>

  <p>
    <term>Russell's Paradox:</term> 
        <idx><h>Russell's Paradox</h></idx>
    Consider the set of all sets which are not elements of themselves.
    We call this set <m>D</m> and ask,
    <q>Is <m>D\in D?</m></q> Symbolically, this set is
    <me>
      D=\{S\ |\ S\not \in S\}
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If <m>D\in D</m>, then by definition, <m>D\not\in D</m>.
    If <m>D\not\in D</m>, then by definition, <m>D\in D</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you look back at the proof of Cantor's Theorem, this was
    basically the idea that gave us the contradiction.  To have such a
    contradiction occurring at the most basic level of mathematics was
    scandalous.  It forced a number of mathematicians and logicians to
    carefully devise the axioms by which sets could be constructed.
    To be honest, most mathematicians still approach set theory from a
    naive point of view as the sets we typically deal with fall under
    the category of what we would call <q>normal sets.</q> In fact,
    such an approach is officially called Naive Set Theory (as opposed
    to Axiomatic Set Theory).  However, attempts to put set theory and
    logic on solid footing led to the modern study of symbolic logic
    and ultimately the design of computer (machine) logic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another place where Cantor's work had a profound influence in
    modern logic comes from something we alluded to before.  We showed
    before that the unit square <m>[0,1]\times [0,1]</m> had the same
    cardinality as an uncountable subset of <m>\RR</m>.  In fact,
    Cantor <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx> showed that the unit square
    had the same cardinality as <m>\RR</m> itself and was moved to
    advance the following in 1878.
  </p>

  <conjecture>
    <title>The Continuum Hypothesis</title>
    <idx><h>Continuum Hypothesis</h><h>original</h></idx> 
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every uncountable subset of <m>\RR</m> has the same cardinality as <m>\RR</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </conjecture>

  <p>
    Cantor was unable to prove or disprove this conjecture (along with
    every other mathematician).  In fact, proving or disproving the
    Continuum Hypothesis, was one of Hilbert's famous 23 problems
    presented as a challenge to mathematicians at the International
    Congress of Mathematicians in 1900.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since <m>\RR</m> has the same cardinality as <m>P(\NN)</m>,
    then the Continuum Hypothesis was generalized to the:
  </p>

  <conjecture>
    <title>The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis</title>
    <idx><h>Continuum Hypothesis</h><h>generalized</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Given an infinite set <m>S</m>,
        there is no infinite set which has a cardinality strictly between that of <m>S</m> and its power set <m>P(S)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </conjecture>
<aside> <title>
The Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms
</title>
<p>
 One of the formal
    axiomatic approaches to set theory established by Ernst Zermelo in
    1908 and revised by Abraham Fraenkel in 1921.
</p>  
</aside>
  <p>
    Efforts to prove or disprove this were in vain and with good
    reason.  In 1940, the logician Kurt G&#xf6;del showed that the
    Continuum Hypothesis could not be disproved from the
    Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms of set theory.  In 1963,
    Paul Cohen showed that the Continuum Hypothesis could not be
    proved using the Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms.  In other words, the
    Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms do not contain enough information to
    decide the truth of the hypothesis.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are willing to bet that at this point your head might be swimming a bit with uncertainty.
    If so, then know that these are the same feelings that the mathematical community experienced in the mid twentieth century.
    In the past,
    mathematics was seen as a model of logical certainty.
    It is disconcerting to find that there are statements that are <q>undecidable.</q>
    In fact, G&#xf6;del proved in 1931 that a consistent finite axiom system that contained the axioms of arithmetic would always contain undecidable statements which could neither be proved true nor false with those axioms.
    Mathematical knowledge would always be incomplete.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
    So by trying to put the foundations of calculus on solid ground,
    we have come to a point where we can never obtain mathematical certainty.
    Does this mean that we should throw up our hands and concede defeat?
    Should we be paralyzed with fear of trying anything?
    Certainly not!
    As we mentioned before,
    most mathematicians do well by taking a pragmatic approach:
    using their mathematics to solve problems that they encounter.
    In fact, it is typically the problems that motivate the mathematics.
    It is true that mathematicians take chances that don't always pan out,
    but they still take these chances, often with success.
    Even when the successes lead to more questions, as they typically do,
    tackling those questions usually leads to a deeper understanding.
    At the very least,
    our incomplete understanding means we will always have more questions to answer,
    more problems to solve.
  </p>

    What else could a mathematician ask for?
