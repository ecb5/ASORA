  <title>Uniform Convergence: Integrals and Derivatives</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We saw in the previous section that if
      <m>\left(f_n\right)</m> is a sequence of continuous functions which converges uniformly to <m>f</m> on an interval,
      then <m>f</m> must be continuous on the interval as well.
      This was not necessarily true if the convergence was only pointwise,
      as we saw a sequence of continuous functions defined on
      <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> converging pointwise to a Fourier series that was not continuous on the real line.
      Uniform convergence guarantees some other nice properties as well.

      The above results say that a power series can be differentiated and integrated term-by-term as long as the convergence is uniform.
      Fortunately it is, in general,
      true that when a power series converges the convergence of it and its integrated and differentiated series is also uniform
      (almost).
    </p>

    <p>
      However we do not yet have all of the tools necessary to see this.
      To build these tools requires that we return briefly to our study,
      begun in <xref ref="chpt_Convergence">Chapter</xref>,
      of the convergence of sequences.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Cauchy Sequences</title>
    <p>
      Knowing that a sequence or a series converges and knowing what it converges to are typically two different matters.
      For example,
      we know that <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!}</m>and <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!\,n!}</m> both converge.
      The first converges to <m>e</m>,
      which has meaning in other contexts.
      We don't know what the second one converges to,
      other than to say it converges to <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!\,n!}</m>.
      In fact, that question might not have much meaning without some other context in which <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!\,n!}</m> arises naturally.
      Be that as it may, we need to look at the convergence of a series
      (or a sequence for that matter)
      without necessarily knowing what it might converge to.
      We make the following definition.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def_CauchySequence">
      <statement>
        <p>
              <idx><h>sequences</h><h>Cauchy sequences</h></idx>
          Let <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> be a sequence of real numbers.
          We say that <m>\left(s_n\right)</m>is a
          <term>Cauchy sequence</term>
          if for any <m>\eps>0</m>,
          there exists a real number <m>N</m> such that if <m>m,n>N</m>,
          then <m>|s_m-s_n|\lt \eps</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Notice that this definition says that the terms in a Cauchy sequence get arbitrarily close to each other and that there is no reference to getting close to any particular fixed real number.
      Furthermore,
      you have already seen lots of examples of Cauchy sequences as illustrated by the following result.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_Converge-_Cauchy">
      <statement>
        <p>
              <idx><h>sequences</h><h>convergence</h></idx>
              <idx><h>convergence</h><h>of a sequence</h><h>implies Cauchy sequence</h></idx>

          Then <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> is a Cauchy sequence.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      Intuitively, this result makes sense.
      If the terms in a sequence are getting arbitrarily close to <m>s</m>,
      then they should be getting arbitrarily close to each other.<fn>
      But the converse isn't nearly as clear.
      In fact, it isn't true in the rational numbers.
      </fn> This is the basis of the proof.
    </p>

    <p>
      So any convergent sequence is automatically Cauchy.
      For the real number system, the converse is also true and,
      in fact, is equivalent to any of our completeness axioms:
      the NIP, the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, or the LUB Property.
      Thus, this could have been taken as our completeness axiom and we could have used it to prove the others.
      One of the most convenient ways to prove this converse is to use the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem.
      To do that, we must first show that a Cauchy sequence must be bounded.
      This result is reminiscent of the fact that a convergent sequence is bounded
      (<xref ref="lemma_BoundedConvergent">Lemma</xref>
      of <xref ref="chpt_Convergence">Chapter</xref>)
      and the proof is very similar.

<title>Sketch of Proof</title>
      <p>
        We know that <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> <m></m>is bounded,

        it has a convergent subsequence
        <m>\left(s_{n_k}\right)</m> converging to some real number <m>s</m>.
        We have <m>|s_n-s|=|s_n-s_{n_k}+s_{n_k}-s|\leq|s_n-s_{n_k}\mathopen|+|s_{n_k}-s|</m>.
        If we choose <m>n</m> and <m>n_k</m> large enough,
        we should be able to make each term arbitrarily small.

    <p>
      From <xref ref="thm_Converge-_Cauchy">Theorem</xref>
      we see that every Cauchy sequence converges in <m>\RR</m>.
      Moreover the proof of this fact depends on the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem which,
      as we have seen,
      is equivalent to our completeness axiom,
      the Nested Interval Property.
      What this means is that if there is a Cauchy sequence which does not converge then the NIP is not true.
      A natural question to ask is if every Cauchy sequence converges does the NIP follow?
      That is, is the convergence of Cauchy sequences also equivalent to our completeness axiom?
      The following theorem shows that the answer is yes.

                If we start with two sequences <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>, satisfying all of the conditions of the NIP, you should be able to show that these are both Cauchy sequences.

      <xref ref="prob_Cauchy_sequences_Cauchy_implies_convergence">Problems</xref>
      and <xref ref="prob_Cauchy_sequences_Cauchy_implies_NIP"></xref>
      tell us that the following are equivalent:
      the Nested Interval Property,
      the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem,
      the Least Upper Bound Property,
      and the convergence of Cauchy sequences.
      Thus any one of these could have been taken as the completeness axiom of the real number system and then used to prove the each of the others as a theorem according to the following dependency graph:

    <p>
      Since we can get from any node on the graph to any other,
      simply by following the implications

      any one of these statements is logically equivalent to each of the others.

      You may also recall the Comparison Test from studying series in calculus:
      suppose <m>0\leq a_n\leq b_n</m>,
      if <m>\sum b_n</m> converges then <m>\sum a_n</m> converges.
      This result follows from the fact that the partial sums of
      <m>\sum a_n</m> form an increasing sequence which is bounded above by <m>\sum b_n</m>.
      (See <xref ref="cor_IncBoundedConverge">Corollary</xref>
      of <xref ref="chpt_IVTEVT">Chapter</xref>.)
      The Cauchy Criterion allows us to extend this to the case where the terms <m>a_n</m> could be negative as well.
      This can be seen in the following theorem.

          Given a series <m>\sum a_n</m>, the series <m>\sum|a_n|</m> is called the {absolute series} of <m>\sum\boldsymbol{a}_{\boldsymbol{n}}</m> and if <m>\sum|a_n|</m>converges then we say that <m>\sum\boldsymbol{a}_{\boldsymbol{n}}</m> converges absolutely.

      The converse of <xref ref="cor_AbsConv-_Conv">Corollary</xref>
      is not true as evidenced by the series <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}</m>.
      As we noted in <xref ref="chpt_PowerSeriesQuestions">Chapter</xref>,
      this series converges to ln <m>2</m>.
      However, its absolute series is the Harmonic
          <idx><h>Harmonic Series</h></idx>
      Series which diverges.
      Any such series which converges,
      but not absolutely, is said to <alert>converge conditionally</alert>.
      Recall also that in <xref ref="chpt_PowerSeriesQuestions">Chapter</xref>,
      we showed that we could rearrange the terms of the series
      <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}</m> to make it converge to any number we wished.
      We noted further that all rearrangements of the series
      <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{\left(n+1\right)^2}</m> converged to the same value.
      The difference between the two series is that the latter converges absolutely whereas the former does not.
      Specifically, we have the following result.

          Suppose <m>\sum a_n</m> converges absolutely and let <m>s=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n</m>.
          Then any rearrangement of <m>\sum a_n</m> must converge to <m>s</m>.

      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
<title>Sketch of Proof</title>
      <p>
        We will first show that this result is true in the case where <m>a_n\geq 0</m>.
        If <m>\sum b_n</m> represents a rearrangement of <m>\sum a_n</m>,
        then notice that the sequence of partial sums
        <m>\left(\sum_{k=0}^nb_k\right)_{n=0}^\infty</m>is an increasing sequence which is bounded by <m>s</m>.
        By <xref ref="cor_IncBoundedConverge">Corollary</xref>
        of <xref ref="chpt_IVTEVT">Chapter</xref>,
        this sequence must converge to some number <m>t</m> and <m>t\leq s</m>.
        Furthermore <m>\sum a_n</m> is also a rearrangement of <m>\sum b_n</m>.
        Thus the result holds for this special case. (Why?) For the general case,
        notice that <m>a_n=\frac{|a_n\mathopen|+a_n}{2}-\frac{|a_n\mathopen|-a_n}{2}</m> and that <m>\sum\frac{|a_n\mathopen|+a_n}{2}</m> and
        <m>\sum\frac{|a_n\mathopen|-a_n}{2}</m> are both convergent series with nonnegative terms.
        By the special case <m>\sum\frac{|b_n\mathopen|+b_n}{2}=</m> <m>\sum\frac{|a_n\mathopen|+a_n}{2}</m> and
        <m>\sum\frac{|b_n\mathopen|-b_n}{2}=</m> <m>\sum\frac{|a_n\mathopen|-a_n}{2}</m>.
