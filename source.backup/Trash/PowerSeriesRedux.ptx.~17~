  <title>Uniform Convergence</title>
  <p>
    We have developed precise analytic definitions of the convergence of a sequence and continuity of a function and we have used these to prove the EVT and IVT for a continuous function.
    We will now draw our attention back to the question that originally motivated these definitions,
    <q>Why are Taylor series well behaved,
    but Fourier series are not necessarily?</q> More precisely,
    we mentioned that whenever a power series converges then whatever it converged to was continuous.
    Moreover, if we differentiate or integrate these series term by term then the resulting series will converge to the derivative or integral of the original series.
    This was not always the case for Fourier series.
    For example consider the function
    <md>
      <mrow>f(x) \amp = \frac{4}{\pi}\left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\cos\left((2k+1)\pi x\right)\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = \frac{4}{\pi}\left(\cos(\pi x)-\frac13\cos(3\pi x)+\frac15 (5\pi x)-\ldots\right)</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have seen that the graph of <m>f</m> is given by 
  </p>

    <image width="85%" source="images/Ch7fig1.png" />

  <p>
    If we consider the following sequence of functions
    <md>
      <mrow>f_1(x)=\amp \frac{4}{\pi}\cos\left(\pi x\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>f_2(x)=\amp \frac{4}{\pi}\left(\cos \left(\pi x\right)-\frac{1}{3}\cos\left( 3\pi x\right)\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>f_3(x)=\amp \frac{4}{\pi}\left(\cos\left(\pi x\right)-\frac{1}{3}\cos\left(3\pi x\right)+\frac{1}{5}\cos\left(5\pi x\right)\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp \vdots</mrow>
    </md>
    we see the sequence of continuous functions
    <m>\left(f_n\right)</m> converges to the non-continuous function <m>f</m> for each real number <m>x</m>.
    This didn't happen with Taylor series.
    The partial sums for a Taylor series were polynomials and hence continuous but what they converged to was continuous as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    The difficulty is quite delicate and it took mathematicians a while to determine the problem.
    There are two very subtly different ways that a sequence of functions can converge:
    pointwise or uniformly.
    This 
        <idx><h>Abel, Niels Henrik</h></idx>
    distinction was touched upon by Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) in 1826 while studying the domain of convergence of a power series.
    However, the necessary formal definitions were not made explicit until Weierstrass 
        <idx><h>Weierstrass, Karl</h></idx> did it in his 1841
        paper <foreign>Zur Theorie der Potenzreihen</foreign> <em>(On
        the Theory of Power Series)</em>. This was published in his
        collected works in 1894.
  </p>

  <p>
    It will be instructive to take a look at an argument that doesn't quite work before looking at the formal definitions we will need.
    In 1821 Augustin Cauchy 
        <idx><h>Cauchy, Augustin</h></idx>
    <q>proved</q> that the infinite sum of continuous functions is continuous.
    Of course, it is obvious
    (to us)
    that this is not true because we've seen several counterexamples.
    But Cauchy, who was a first rate mathematician was so sure of the correctness of his argument that he included it in his textbook on analysis,
    <foreign>Cours d'analyse</foreign> (1821).

        Find the flaw in the following <q>proof</q> that <m>f</m> is also continuous at <m>a</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose <m>f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4 \ldots</m> are all continuous at <m>a</m> and that <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n=f</m>.
        Let <m>\eps>0</m>.
        Since <m>f_n</m> is continuous at <m>a</m>,
        we can choose <m>\delta_n>0</m> such that if <m>\abs{x-a}\lt \delta_n</m>,
        then <m>\abs{f_n(x)-f_n(a)}\lt \frac{\eps}{2^n}</m>.
        Let <m>\delta=\inf(\delta_1,\delta_2,\delta_3,\ldots)</m>.
        If <m>\abs{x-a}\lt \delta</m> then
        <md>
          <mrow>\abs{f(x)-f(a)} \amp =  \abs{\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)  -  \sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(a) }</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \abs{\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(f_n(x)-f_n(a)\right) }</mrow>

      <p>
        Thus <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>a</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
            <idx><h>convergence</h><h>of a series</h><h>pointwise</h></idx>
        Let <m>S</m> be a subset of the real number system and let <m>\left(f_n\right)=\left(f_1,f_2,f_3,\,\ldots\right)</m> be a sequence of functions defined on <m>S</m>.
        Let <m>f</m> be a function defined on <m>S</m> as well.
        We say that  <m>\left(f_n\right)</m> <alert>converges to
              <m>f</m> pointwise on <m>S</m></alert>
            provided that for all <m>x\in S</m>,
        the sequence of real numbers
        <m>\left(f_n(x)\right)</m> converges to the number <m>f(x)</m>.
        In this case we write<m>\,f_n\ptwise f</m> on <m>S</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Symbolically,
    we have <m>f_n\ptwise f\text{ on } S\Leftrightarrow \forall\,x\in S,\forall\ \eps>0,\,\exists\ N</m> such that <m>\left(n>N \Rightarrow|f_n(x)-f(x)|\lt \eps\right)</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the type of convergence we have been observing to this point.
    By contrast we have the following new definition.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_UniformConvergence">
    <statement>
      <p>
            <idx><h>uniform convergence</h></idx>
        Let <m>S</m> be a subset of the real number system and let <m>\left(f_n\right)=\left(f_1,f_2,f_3,\,\ldots\right)</m> be a sequence of functions defined on <m>S</m>.
        Let <m>f</m> be a function defined on <m>S</m> as well.
        We say that <m>\left(f_n\right)</m> <alert>converges to
              <m>f</m> uniformly on <m>S</m></alert>
        provided <m>\forall\ \eps>0,\,\exists\ N</m> such
        that <m>n>N\Rightarrow|f_n(x)-f(x)|\lt \eps\text{ , } \forall\
        x\in S</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case we write <m>f_n\unif f</m> on <m>S</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The difference between these two definitions is subtle.
    In pointwise convergence,
    we are given a fixed <m>x\in S</m> and an <m>\eps>0</m>.
    Then the task is to find an <m>N</m> that works for that particular <m>x</m> and <m>\eps</m>.
    In uniform convergence,
    one is given <m>\eps>0</m> and must find a single <m>N</m> that works for that particular <m>\eps</m> but also simultaneously (uniformly) for all <m>x\in S</m>.
    Clearly uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence as an <m>N</m> which works uniformly for all <m>x</m>,
    works for each individual <m>x</m> also.
    However the reverse is not true.
    This will become evident, but first consider the following example.
  </p>

  <problem xml:id="prob_uniform_convergence">
    <idx><h>uniform convergence</h></idx>
    <idx><h><m>x^n</m></h><h> converges uniformly on <m>(0,b)</m>, <m>b\lt 1</m></h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>0\lt b\lt 1</m> and consider the sequence of functions <m>\left(f_n\right)</m> defined on <m>[0,b]</m> by <m>f_n(x)=x^n</m>.
        Use the definition to show that
        <m>f_n\unif 0</m> on <m>[0,b]</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
        <hint>
    <p>
      <m>|x^n-0|=x^n\leq b^n</m>.
    </p>
    </hint>
  </problem>

  <p>
    Uniform convergence is not only dependent on the sequence of functions but also on the set <m>S</m>.
    For example,
    the sequence <m>\left(f_n(x)\right)=\left(x^n\right)_{n=0}^\infty</m> of <xref ref="prob_uniform_convergence">Problem</xref>
    does not converge uniformly on <m>[0,1]</m>.
    We could use the negation of the definition to prove this,
    but instead, it will be a consequence of the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_UnifConv-_Continuity">

        Consider a sequence of functions <m>\left(f_n\right)</m> which are all continuous on an interval <m>I</m>.
        Suppose <m>f_n\unif f</m> on <m>I</m>.
        Then <m>f</m> must be continuous on <m>I</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
<title>Sketch of Proof</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>a\in I</m> and let <m>\eps>0</m>.
      The idea is to use uniform convergence to replace <m>f</m> with one of the known continuous functions <m>f_n</m>.
      Specifically, by uncancelling, we can write
      <md>
        <mrow>\left|f(x)-f(a)\right|\amp =\left|f(x)-f_n(x)+f_n(x)-f_n(a)+f_n(a)-f(a)\right|</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \leq \left|f(x)-f_n(x)\right|+\left|f_n(x)-f_n(a)\right|+\left|f_n(a)-f(a)\right|</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we choose <m>n</m> large enough,
      then we can make the first and last terms as small as we wish,
      noting that the uniform convergence makes the first term uniformly small for all <m>x</m>.
      Once we have a specific <m>n</m>,
      then we can use the continuity of <m>f_n</m> to find a
      <m>\delta>0</m> such that the middle term is small whenever <m>x</m> is within <m>\delta</m> of <m>a</m>.

    Notice that for the Fourier series at the beginning of this chapter,
    <me>
      f(x)=\frac{4}{\pi}\left(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}x\right)-\frac{1}{3}\cos\left( 3\pi x\right)+\frac{1}{5}\cos\left(5\pi x\right)-\frac{1}{7}\cos\left(7\pi x\right)+\cdots\right)
    </me>
    the convergence cannot be uniform on <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>,
    as the function <m>f</m> is not continuous.
    This never happens with a power series,
    since they converge to continuous functions whenever they converge.
    We will also see that uniform convergence is what allows us to integrate and differentiate a power series term by term.

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We saw in the previous section that if
      <m>\left(f_n\right)</m> is a sequence of continuous functions which converges uniformly to <m>f</m> on an interval,
      then <m>f</m> must be continuous on the interval as well.
      This was not necessarily true if the convergence was only pointwise,
      as we saw a sequence of continuous functions defined on
      <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> converging pointwise to a Fourier series that was not continuous on the real line.
      Uniform convergence guarantees some other nice properties as well.

      Fortunately it is, in general,
      true that when a power series converges the convergence of it and its integrated and differentiated series is also uniform
      (almost).

      However we do not yet have all of the tools necessary to see this.
      To build these tools requires that we return briefly to our study,
      begun in <xref ref="Convergence">Chapter</xref>,
      of the convergence of sequences.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Cauchy Sequences</title>
    <p>
      Knowing that a sequence or a series converges and knowing what it converges to are typically two different matters.
      For example,
      we know that <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!}</m>and <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!\,n!}</m> both converge.
      The first converges to <m>e</m>,
      which has meaning in other contexts.
      We don't know what the second one converges to,
      other than to say it converges to <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!\,n!}</m>.
      In fact, that question might not have much meaning without some other context in which <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!\,n!}</m> arises naturally.
      Be that as it may, we need to look at the convergence of a series
      (or a sequence for that matter)
      without necessarily knowing what it might converge to.
      We make the following definition.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def_CauchySequence">
      <statement>
        <p>
              <idx><h>sequences</h><h>Cauchy sequences</h></idx>
          Let <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> be a sequence of real numbers.
          We say that <m>\left(s_n\right)</m>is a
          <term>Cauchy sequence</term>
          if for any <m>\eps>0</m>,
          there exists a real number <m>N</m> such that if <m>m,n>N</m>,
          then <m>|s_m-s_n|\lt \eps</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Notice that this definition says that the terms in a Cauchy sequence get arbitrarily close to each other and that there is no reference to getting close to any particular fixed real number.
      Furthermore,
      you have already seen lots of examples of Cauchy sequences as illustrated by the following result.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_Converge-_Cauchy">
      <statement>

          Suppose <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> is a sequence of real numbers which converges to <m>s</m>.
          Then <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> is a Cauchy sequence.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      Intuitively, this result makes sense.
      If the terms in a sequence are getting arbitrarily close to <m>s</m>,
      then they should be getting arbitrarily close to each other. This is the basis of the proof.
    </p>
<aside>
<p>
      But the converse isn't nearly as clear.
      In fact, it isn't true in the rational numbers.

      So any convergent sequence is automatically Cauchy.
      For the real number system, the converse is also true and,
      in fact, is equivalent to any of our completeness axioms:
      the NIP, the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, or the LUB Property.
      Thus, this could have been taken as our completeness axiom and we could have used it to prove the others.
      One of the most convenient ways to prove this converse is to use the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem.
      To do that, we must first show that a Cauchy sequence must be bounded.
      This result is reminiscent of the fact that a convergent sequence is bounded
      (<xref ref="lemma_BoundedConvergent">Lemma</xref>
      of <xref ref="Convergence">Chapter</xref>)
      and the proof is very similar.

      <p>
        We know that <m>\left(s_n\right)</m> <m></m>is bounded,

        If we choose <m>n</m> and <m>n_k</m> large enough,

    <p>
      From <xref ref="thm_Converge-_Cauchy">Theorem</xref>
      we see that every Cauchy sequence converges in <m>\RR</m>.
      Moreover the proof of this fact depends on the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem which,
      as we have seen,
      is equivalent to our completeness axiom,
      the Nested Interval Property.
      What this means is that if there is a Cauchy sequence which does not converge then the NIP is not true.
      A natural question to ask is if every Cauchy sequence converges does the NIP follow?
      That is, is the convergence of Cauchy sequences also equivalent to our completeness axiom?
      The following theorem shows that the answer is yes.

      <xref ref="prob_Cauchy_sequences_Cauchy_implies_convergence">Problems</xref>

      tell us that the following are equivalent:
      the Nested Interval Property,
      the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem,
      the Least Upper Bound Property,
      and the convergence of Cauchy sequences.
      Thus any one of these could have been taken as the completeness axiom of the real number system and then used to prove the each of the others as a theorem according to the following dependency graph:

    <p>
      Since we can get from any node on the graph to any other,
      simply by following the implications
      (indicated with arrows),
      any one of these statements is logically equivalent to each of the others.

      You may also recall the Comparison Test from studying series in calculus:
      suppose <m>0\leq a_n\leq b_n</m>,
      if <m>\sum b_n</m> converges then <m>\sum a_n</m> converges.
      This result follows from the fact that the partial sums of
      <m>\sum a_n</m> form an increasing sequence which is bounded above by <m>\sum b_n</m>.
      (See <xref ref="cor_IncBoundedConverge">Corollary</xref>
      of <xref ref="IVTandEVT">Chapter</xref>.)
      The Cauchy Criterion allows us to extend this to the case where the terms <m>a_n</m> could be negative as well.

        If <m>\sum b_n</m> represents a rearrangement of <m>\sum a_n</m>,

  <p>
    As a result of <xref ref="thm_RadiusOfConvergence">Theorem</xref>
    and <xref ref="cor_RadiusOfDivergence">Corollary</xref>,
    we have the following:
    either <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> converges absolutely for all <m>x</m> or there exists some nonnegative real number <m>r</m> such that
    <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> converges absolutely when
    <m>|x|\lt r</m> and diverges when <m>|x|>r</m>.
    In the latter case, we call <m>r</m> the
    <em>radius of convergence</em>
    of the power series <m>\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n} x^{n}</m>.
    In the former case,
    we say that the radius of convergence of <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> is <m>\infty</m>.
    Though we can say that <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> converges absolutely when <m>|x|\lt r</m>,
    we cannot say that the convergence is uniform.
    However, we can come close.
    We can show that the convergence is uniform for <m>|x|\leq b\lt r</m>.
    To see this we will use the following result

        <me>
          \abs{f_n(x)}\leq M_n,\,\, \forall x\in S,\,\, n=1, 2, 3, \ldots
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty M_n</m> converges then
        <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)</m> converges uniformly on <m>S</m> to some function (which we will denote by <m>f(x)</m>).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
<title>Sketch of Proof</title>
    <p>
      Since the crucial feature of the theorem is the function <m>f(x)</m> that our series converges to,
      our plan of attack is to first define <m>f(x)</m> and then show that our series,
      <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)</m>,
      converges to it uniformly.
    </p>

    <p>
      First observe that for any <m>x\in S</m>,
      <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)</m> converges by the Comparison Test
      (in fact it converges absolutely)
      to some number we will denote by <m>f(x)</m>.
      This actually defines the function <m>f(x)</m> for all <m>x\in S</m>.
      It follows that <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)</m> converges pointwise to <m>f(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, let <m>\eps>0</m> be given.
      Notice that since <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty M_n</m> converges,
      say to <m>M</m>,
      then there is a real number, <m>N</m>,
      such that if <m>n>N</m>, then
      <me>
        \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty M_k = \abs{\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty M_k} = \abs{M-\sum_{k=1}^n M_k}\lt \eps
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should be able to use this to show that if <m>n>N</m>, then
      <me>
        \abs{f(x) - \sum_{k=1}^n f_k(x)}\lt  \eps, \, \, \forall x\in S

  <p>
    To finish the story on differentiating and integrating power series,
    all we need to do is show that the power series, its integrated series,
    and its differentiated series all have the same radius of convergence.
    You might not realize it,
    but we already know that the integrated series has a radius of convergence at least as big as the radius of convergence of the original series.
    Specifically,
    suppose <m>f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m>has a radius of convergence <m>r</m> and let <m>|x|\lt r</m>.
    We know that <m>\,\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> converges uniformly on an interval containing <m>0</m>and <m>x</m>,
    and so by <xref ref="cor_IntConvUni">Corollary</xref>,
    <m>\int_{t=0}^xf(t)\dx{ t}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{a_n}{n+1}x^{n+1}\right)</m>.
    In other words,
    the integrated series converges for any <m>x</m> with<m>\,|x|\lt r</m>.
    This says that the radius of convergence of the integated series must be at least <m>r</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To show that the radii of convergence are the same,
    all we need to show is that the radius of convergence of the differentiated series is at least as big as <m>r</m> as well.
    Indeed, since the differentiated series of the integrated series is the original,
    then this would say that the original series and the integrated series have the same radii of convergence.
    Putting the differentiated series into the role of the original series,
    the original series is now the integrated series and so these would have the same radii of convergence as well.
    With this in mind, we want to show that if <m>|x|\lt r</m>,
    then <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nnx^{n-1}</m> converges.
    The strategy is to mimic what we did in <xref ref="thm_RadiusOfConvergence">Theorem</xref>,
    where we essentially compared our series with a converging geometric series.
    Only this time we need to start with the differentiated geometric series.

<section xml:id="PowerSeriesRedux-AbelsThm">
  <title>Boundary Issues and Abel's Theorem</title>
  <p>
    Summarizing our results,
    we see that any power series
    <m>\sum a_nx^n</m> has a radius of convergence <m>r</m> such that
    <m>\sum a_nx^n</m> converges absolutely when
    <m>|x|\lt r</m> and diverges when <m>|x|>r</m>.
    Furthermore, the convergence is uniform on any closed interval
    <m>[-b,b]\subset(-r,r)</m> which tells us that whatever the power series converges to must be a continuous function on <m>(-r,r)</m>.
    Lastly, if <m>f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> for <m>x\in(-r,r)</m>,
    then <m>f^\prime(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nnx^{n-1}</m> for <m>x\in(-r,r)</m> and
    <m>\int_{t=0}^xf(t)\dx{ t} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}</m> for <m>x\in(-r,r)</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus power series are very well behaved within their interval of convergence,
    and our cavalier approach from <xref ref="CalcIn17th18thCentury">Chapter</xref>
    is justified, <alert>EXCEPT</alert> for one issue.
    If you go back to <xref ref="prob_alternating_harmonic_series">Problem</xref>
    of <xref ref="CalcIn17th18thCentury">Chapter</xref>,
    you see that we used the geometric series to obtain the series,
    <m>\arctan x =\sum_{n=0}^\infty(-1)^n\frac{1}{2n+1}x^{2n+1}</m>.
    We substituted <m>x=1</m> into this to obtain <m>\frac{\pi}{4}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty(-1)^n\frac{1}{2n+1}</m>.
    Unfortunately,
    our integration was only guaranteed on a closed subinterval of the interval <m>(-1,1)</m> where the convergence was uniform and we substituted in <m>x=1</m>.
    We <q>danced on the boundary</q> in other places as well,
    including when we said that
    <me>
      \frac{\pi}{4}=\int_{x=0}^1\sqrt{1-x^2}dx=1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\left(\frac{\prod_{j=0}^{n-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}-j\right)}{n!}\text{ } \right)\left(\frac{\left(-1\right)^n}{2n+1}\right)
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fact is that for a power series
    <m>\sum a_nx^n</m> with radius of convergence <m>r</m>,
    we know what happens for <m>x</m> with
    <m>|x|\lt r</m>and <m>x</m> with <m>|x|>r</m>.
    We never talked about what happens for <m>x</m> with <m>|x|=r</m>.
    That is because there is no systematic approach to this boundary problem.
    For example, consider the three series
    <me>
      \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n,\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}, \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^{n+2}}{(n+1)(n+2)}
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are all related in that we started with the geometric series and integrated twice,
    thus they all have radius of convergence equal to 1.
    Their behavior on the boundary,
    i.e., when <m>x=\pm 1</m>, is another story.
    The first series diverges when <m>x=\pm 1</m>,
    the third series converges when <m>x=\pm 1</m>.
    The second series converges when <m>x=-1</m> and diverges when <m>x=1</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even with the unpredictability of a power series at the endpoints of its interval of convergence,
    the Weierstrass-<m>M</m> test does give us some hope of uniform convergence.
  </p>

        Suppose the power series <m>\sum a_nx^n</m> has radius of convergence <m>r</m> and the series <m>\sum a_nr^n</m> converges absolutely.
        Then <m>\sum a_nx^n</m> converges uniformly on <m>[-r,r]</m>.

        For <m>|x|\leq r</m>, <m>|a_nx^n|\leq |a_nr^n|</m>.
      </p>
    </hint>
  </problem>

  <p>
    Unfortunately,
    this result doesn't apply to the integrals we mentioned as the convergence at the endpoints is not absolute.
    Nonetheless,
    the integrations we performed in <xref ref="CalcIn17th18thCentury">Chapter</xref> are still legitimate.
    This is due to the following theorem by Abel which 
        <idx><h>Abel, Niels Henrik</h></idx>
    extends uniform convergence to the endpoints of the interval of convergence even if the convergence at an endpoint is only conditional.
    Abel did not use the term uniform convergence,
    as it hadn't been defined yet,
    but the ideas involved are his.
