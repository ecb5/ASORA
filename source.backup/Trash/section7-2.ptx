         Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is continuous on 
          <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>v</m> is any real number between 
          <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>.
          Then there exists a real number
          <m>c\in[\,a,b]</m> such that <m>f(c)=v</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
<title>Sketch of Proof</title>
    <p>
      We have two cases to consider:
      <m>f(a)\leq v\leq f(b)</m> and <m>f(a)\geq v\geq f(b)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will look at the case <m>f(a)\leq v\leq f(b)</m>.
      Let <m>x_1=a</m> and <m>y_1=b</m>,
      so we have <m>x_1\leq y_1</m> and <m>f(x_1)\leq v\leq f(y_1)</m>.
      Let <m>\,m_1</m> be the midpoint of
      <m>[\,x_1,y_1]</m> and notice that we have either
      <m>f(m_1)\leq v</m> or <m>f(m_1)\geq v</m>.
      If <m>f(m_1)\leq v</m> , then we relabel <m>x_2=m_1</m> and <m>y_2=y_1</m>.
      If <m>f(m_1)\geq v</m> , then we relabel <m>x_2=x_1</m> and <m>y_2=m_1</m>.
      In either case, we end up with <m>x_1\leq x_2\leq y_2\leq y_1</m>,
      <m>y_2-x_2=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_1-x_1\right)</m>,
      <m>f(x_1)\leq v\leq f(y_1)</m>,
      and <m>f(x_2)\leq v\leq f(y_2)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now play the same game with the interval <m>[\,x_2,y_2]</m>.
      If we keep playing this game,
      we will generate two sequences
      <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>,
      satisfying all of the conditions of the nested interval property.
      These sequences will also satisfy the following extra property:
      <m>\forall</m> <m>n,\,f(x_n)\leq v\leq f(y_n)</m>.
      By the NIP, there exists a <m>c</m> such that
      <m>\,x_n\leq c\leq y_n</m>, <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>.
      This should be the <m>c</m> that we seek though this is not obvious.
      Specifically, we need to show that <m>f(c)=v</m>.
      This should be where the continuity of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m> and the extra property on
      <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m> come into play.

        Turn the ideas of the previous paragraphs into a formal proof of the IVT for the case <m>f(a)\leq v\leq f(b)</m>.

            <idx><h>Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)</h><h>the case <m>f(a)\geq v\geq f(b)</m></h></idx>
        We can modify the proof of the case <m>f(a)\leq v\leq f(b)</m> into a proof of the IVT for the case <m>f(a)\geq v\geq f(b)</m>.
        However, there is a sneakier way to prove this case by applying the IVT to the function <m>-f</m>.
        Do this to prove the IVT for the case <m>f(a)\geq v\geq f(b)</m>.
