<section xml:id="IVTandEVT-Completeness">
  <title>Completeness of the Real Number System</title>
  <p>
    Recall that in deriving the Lagrange and Cauchy forms of the remainder for Taylor series,
    we made use of the Extreme Value Theorem (<term>EVT</term>) and Intermediate Value Theorem (<term>IVT</term>).
    In <xref ref="Continuity">Chapter</xref>,
    we produced an analytic definition of continuity that we can use to prove these theorems.
    To provide the rest of the necessary tools we need to explore the make-up of the real number system.
    To illustrate what we mean,
    suppose that we only used the rational number system.
    We could still use our definition of continuity and could still consider continuous functions such as <m>f(x)=x^2</m>.
    Notice that <m>2</m> is a value that lies between <m>f(1)=1</m> and <m>f(2)=4</m>.
  </p>

    <image width="37%" source="images/Ch6fig1.png" />

  <p>
    The IVT says that somewhere between <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>,
    <m>f</m> must take on the value <m>2</m>.
    That is, there must exist some number
    <m>c\in[1,2]</m> such that <m>f(c)=2</m>.
    You might say, <q>Big deal!
    Everyone knows <m>c=\sqrt{2}</m> works.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    However, we are only working with rational numbers and
    <m>\sqrt{2}</m> <m></m>is not rational.
    As we saw in <xref ref="NumbersRealRational">Chapter</xref>
    the rational number system has holes in it,
    whereas the real number system doesn't.
    Again, <q>Big deal!
    Let's just say that the real number system contains (square) roots.</q>
  </p>

  <p>
    This sounds reasonable and it actually works for square roots,
    but consider the function <m>f(x)=x-\cos x</m>.
    We know this is a continuous function.
    We also know that <m>f(0)=-1</m> and <m>f(\frac{\pi}{2})=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
    According to the IVT, there should be some number
    <m>c\in[\,0,\frac{\pi}{2}]</m>, where <m>f(c)=0</m>.
    The graph is below.
  </p>

    <image width="37%" source="images/Ch6fig2.png" />

  <p>
    The situation is not as transparent as before.
    What would this mysterious <m>c</m> be where the curve crosses the <m>x</m> axis?
    Somehow we need to convey the idea that the real number system is a continuum.
    That is, it has no <q>holes</q> in it.
  </p>

  <p>
    How about this?
    Why don't we just say that it has no holes in it?
    Sometimes the simple answer works best!
    But not in this case.
    How are we going to formulate a rigorous proof based on this statement?
    Just like with convergence and continuity,
    what we need is a rigorous way to convey this idea that the real number system does not have any holes,
    that it is <em>complete.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    We will see that there are several different,
    but equivalent ways to convey this notion of completeness.
    We will explore some of them in this chapter.
    For now we adopt the following as our
    <em>Completeness Axiom</em>
    for the real number system.
  </p>

  <axiom xml:id="NIP"><title>Nested Interval Property of the Real Number System (<term>NIP</term>)</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose we have two sequences of real numbers
      <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m> satisfying the
      following conditions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x_1\leq x_2\leq x_3\leq\ldots</m> (this says that the sequence, <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>, is non-decreasing)
          </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>y_1\geq y_2\geq y_3\geq\ldots</m> (this says that the sequence, <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>, is non-increasing)
<!-- (this says that the sequence, <m>\left(y_n\right)\</m>,is non-increasing) -->
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>, <m>x_n\leq y_n</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(y_n-x_n\right)=0</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there exists a unique number <m>c</m> such that <m>x_n\leq
      c\leq y_n</m> for all <m>n</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  </axiom>
  <p>
    Geometrically, we have the following situation.
  </p>

    <image width="75%" source="images/Ch6fig3.png" />

  <p>
    Notice that we have two sequences
    <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>, one increasing
    (really non-decreasing)
    and one decreasing
    (non-increasing).
    These sequences do not pass each other.
    In fact, the following is true:
  </p>

  <problem>
    <idx><h>Nested Interval Property (NIP)</h><h>endpoints</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(x_n), (y_n)</m> be sequences as in the NIP. Show that
        for all <m>n, m \in\NN</m>, <m>x_n\le y_m</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    They are also coming together in the sense that
    <m>\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(y_n-x_n\right)=0</m>.  The NIP
    says that in this case there is a unique real number <m>c</m> in
    the middle of all of this <m>x_n\leq c\leq y_n</m> for all
    <m>n\in\NN</m>.
  </p>

    <image width="75%" source="images/Ch6fig4.png" />

  <p>
    If there was no such <m>c</m> then there would be a hole where
    these two sequences come together.  The NIP guarantees that there
    is no such hole.  We do not need to prove this since an axiom is,
    by definition, a self evident truth.  We are taking it on faith
    that the real number system obeys this law.  The next problem
    shows that the completeness property distinguishes the real number
    system from the rational number system.

          no rational number <m>c</m> satisfying the conclusion of
          the NIP.

          NIP.

    </task>
  </problem>

  <p>
    You might find the name <q>Nested Interval Property</q> to be somewhat curious.
    One way to think about this property is to consider that we have a sequence of
    <q>nested closed intervals</q>
    <m>[\,x_1,y_1]\supseteq[\,x_2,y_2]\supseteq[\,x_3,y_3]\supseteq\cdots</m> whose lengths
    <m>\,y_n-x_n</m> are <q>shrinking to <m>0</m>.</q>
    The conclusion is that the intersection of these intervals is non-empty and,
    in fact, consists of a single point.
    That is, <m>\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty[x_n,y_n]=\{c\}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    It appears that the sequences <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> and
    <m>\left(y_n\right)</m> in the NIP converge to <m>c</m>.
    This is, in fact, true and can be proven rigorously.
    In what follows,
    this will prove to be a valuable piece of information.

  <p>
    To illustrate the idea that the NIP <q>plugs the holes</q> in the
    real line, we will prove the existence of square roots of
    nonnegative real numbers.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_SqrtsExist">
    <idx><h>square roots exist</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>a\in\mathbb{R},\,a\geq 0</m>.
        There exists a real number <m>c\geq 0</m> such that <m>c^2=a</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Notice that we can't just say,
    <q>Let <m>c=\sqrt{a}</m>,</q> since the idea is to show that this square root exists.
    In fact, throughout this proof,
    we cannot really use a square root symbol as we haven't yet proved that they
    (square roots)
    exist.
    We will give the idea behind the proof as it illustrates how the NIP is used.
  </p>

  <proof>
<title>Sketch of Proof</title>
    <p>
      Our strategy is to construct two sequences which will <q>narrow in</q>
      on the number <m>c</m> that we seek.
      With that in mind, we need to find a number <m>x_1</m> such that
      <m>x_1^2\leq a</m> and a number <m>y_1</m> such that <m>y_1^2\geq a</m>.
      (Remember that we can't say
      <m>\sqrt{x_1}</m> or<m>\sqrt{y_1}</m>.)
      There are many possibilities,
      but how about <m>x_1=0</m> and
      <m>y_1=a+1?</m> You can check that these will satisfy <m>x_1^2\leq a\leq</m> <m>y_1^2</m>.
      Furthermore <m>x_1\leq y_1</m>.
      This is the starting point.
    </p>

    <p>
      The technique we will employ is often called a bisection technique,
      and is a useful way to set ourselves up for applying the NIP. Let <m>m_1</m> be the midpoint of the interval <m>[\,x_1,y_1]</m>.
      Then either we have <m>m_1^2\leq a</m> or <m>m_1^2\geq a</m>.
      In the case <m>m_1^2\leq a</m>,
      we really want <m>m_1</m> to take the place of <m>x_1</m> since it is larger than <m>\,x_1</m>,
      but still represents an underestimate for what would be the square root of <m>a</m>.
      This thinking prompts the following move.
      If <m>m_1^2\leq a</m>,
      we will relabel things by letting <m>x_2=m_1</m> and <m>y_2=y_1</m>.
      The situation looks like this on the number line.
    </p>

      <image width="56%" source="images/Ch6fig5.png" />

    <p>
      In the other case where <m>a\leq m_1^2</m>,
      we will relabel things by letting <m>x_2=x_1</m> and <m>y_2=m_1</m>.
      The situation looks like this on the number line.
    </p>

      <image width="56%" source="images/Ch6fig6.png" />

    <p>
      In either case,
      we've reduced the length of the interval where the square root lies to half the size it was before.
      Stated in more specific terms,
      in either case we have the same results:
      <me>
        x_1\leq x_2\leq y_2\leq y_1;\ \  x_1^2\leq a\leq y_1^2;\ \  x_2^2\leq a\leq y_2^2
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        y_2-x_2=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_1-x_1\right)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we play the same game,
      but instead we start with the interval <m>[x_2,y_2]</m>.
      Let <m>m_2</m> be the midpoint of <m>[x_2,y_2]</m>.
      Then we have <m>m_2^2\leq a</m> or <m>m_2^2\geq a</m>.
      If <m>m_2^2\leq a</m>, we relabel <m>x_3=m_2</m> and <m>y_3=y_2</m>.
      If <m>a\leq m_2^2</m>, we relabel <m>x_3=x_2</m> and <m>y_3=m_2</m>.
      In either case, we end up with
      <me>
        x_1\leq x_2\leq x_3\leq y_3\leq y_2\leq y_1;\ \   x_1^2\leq a\leq y_1^2;\ \  x_2^2\leq a\leq y_2^2;\ \   x_3^2\leq a\leq y_3^2
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        y_3-x_3=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_2-x_2\right)=\frac{1}{2^2}\left(y_1-x_1\right)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Continuing in this manner, we will produce two sequences,
      <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>and
      <m>\left(y_n\right)</m> satisfying the following conditions:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>x_1\leq x_2\leq x_3\leq\ldots</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>y_1\geq y_2\geq y_3\geq\ldots</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>, <m>x_n\leq y_n</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(y_n-x_n\right)=\,\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\left(y_1-x_1\right)=0</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            These sequences also satisfy the following property:
            <me>
              \forall n,\,x_n^2\leq a\leq y_n^2
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Properties 1-4 tell us that <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>and
      <m>\left(y_n\right)</m> satisfy all of the conditions of the NIP, so we can conclude that there must exist a real number <m>c</m> such that <m>x_n\leq c\leq y_n</m> for all <m>n</m>.
      At this point,
      you should be able to use property 5. to show that <m>c^2=a</m> as desired.
    </p>

        Turn the above outline into a formal proof of <xref ref="thm_SqrtsExist">Theorem</xref>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </problem>

  <p>
    The bisection method we employed in the proof of <xref ref="thm_SqrtsExist">Theorem</xref>
    is pretty typical of how we will use the NIP, as taking midpoints ensures that we will create a sequence of
    <q>nested intervals.</q>
    We will employ this strategy in the proofs of the IVT and EVT. Deciding how to relabel the endpoints of our intervals will be determined by what we want to do with these two sequences of real numbers.
    This will typically lead to a fifth property,
    which will be crucial in proving that the <m>c</m> guaranteed by the NIP does what we want it to do.
    Specifically, in the above example,
    we always wanted our candidate for
    <m>\sqrt{a}</m> to be in the interval <m>[\,x_n,y_n]</m>.
    This judicious choice led to the extra Property<nbsp />5:
    <m>\forall</m> <m>n,\,x_n^2\leq a\leq y_n^2</m>.
    In applying the NIP to prove the IVT and EVT, we will find that properties 1-4 will stay the same.
    Property<nbsp />5 is what will change based on the property we want <m>c</m> to have.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before we tackle the IVT and EVT, let's use the NIP to address an
    interesting question about the Harmonic Series.
    <idx><h>series</h><h>Harmonic Series</h><h>slow divergence of</h></idx> 
    Recall that the Harmonic Series,
    <m>1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\cdots</m>, grows without
    bound, that is, <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}=\infty</m>.  The
    question is how slowly does this series grow?  For example, how
    many terms would it take before the series surpasses 100? 1000?
    10000?  Leonhard Euler <idx><h>Euler, Leonhard</h></idx> decided
    to tackle this problem in the following way.  Euler decided to
    consider the
    <m>\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+
    \frac{1}{n}\right)-\text{ ln } \left(n+1\right)\right)</m>.  This
    limit is called Euler's constant and is denoted by <m>\gamma</m>.
    This says that for <m>n</m> large, we have
    <m>1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\approx</m>ln<m>\left(n+1\right)+\gamma</m>.
    If we could approximate <m>\gamma</m>, then we could replace the
    inequality <m>1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\geq
    100</m> with the more tractable inequality
    ln<m>\left(n+1\right)+\gamma</m> <m>\geq 0</m> and solve for
    <m>n</m> in this.  This should tell us roughly how many terms
    would need to be added in the Harmonic Series to surpass 100.
    Approximating <m>\gamma</m> with a computer is not too bad.  We
    could make <m>n</m> as large as we wish in
    <m>\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\right)-</m>ln<m>\left(1+n\right)</m>
    to make closer approximations for <m>\gamma</m>.  The real issue
    is, <alert>HOW DO WE KNOW THAT</alert>
    <me>
      \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\right)-\text{ ln } \left(\text{n} +1\right)\right)
    </me>
    <alert>ACTUALLY EXISTS?</alert>
  </p>

  <p>
    You might want to say that obviously it should,
    but let us point out that as of the printing of this book (2013),
    it is not even known if <m>\gamma</m> is rational or irrational.
    So, in our opinion the existence of this limit is not so obvious.
    This is where the NIP will come into play;
    we will use it to show that this limit, in fact, exists.
    The details are in the following problem.

  <title>Proof of the Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
  <p>
    We now have all of the tools we need to prove the Intermediate
    Value Theorem (<term>IVT</term>).
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="IntermediateValueTheorem">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <term>Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)</term>
      </p>
      <p>
        <idx><h>Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)</h></idx> 
         Suppose <m>f(x)</m> is continuous on 
          <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>v</m> is any real number between 
          <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>.
          Then there exists a real number
          <m>c\in[\,a,b]</m> such that <m>f(c)=v</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
<title>Sketch of Proof</title>
    <p>
      We have two cases to consider:
      <m>f(a)\leq v\leq f(b)</m> and <m>f(a)\geq v\geq f(b)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will look at the case <m>f(a)\leq v\leq f(b)</m>.
      Let <m>x_1=a</m> and <m>y_1=b</m>,
      so we have <m>x_1\leq y_1</m> and <m>f(x_1)\leq v\leq f(y_1)</m>.
      Let <m>\,m_1</m> be the midpoint of
      <m>[\,x_1,y_1]</m> and notice that we have either
      <m>f(m_1)\leq v</m> or <m>f(m_1)\geq v</m>.
      If <m>f(m_1)\leq v</m> , then we relabel <m>x_2=m_1</m> and <m>y_2=y_1</m>.
      If <m>f(m_1)\geq v</m> , then we relabel <m>x_2=x_1</m> and <m>y_2=m_1</m>.
      In either case, we end up with <m>x_1\leq x_2\leq y_2\leq y_1</m>,
      <m>y_2-x_2=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_1-x_1\right)</m>,
      <m>f(x_1)\leq v\leq f(y_1)</m>,
      and <m>f(x_2)\leq v\leq f(y_2)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now play the same game with the interval <m>[\,x_2,y_2]</m>.
      If we keep playing this game,
      we will generate two sequences
      <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>,
      satisfying all of the conditions of the nested interval property.
      These sequences will also satisfy the following extra property:
      <m>\forall</m> <m>n,\,f(x_n)\leq v\leq f(y_n)</m>.
      By the NIP, there exists a <m>c</m> such that
      <m>\,x_n\leq c\leq y_n</m>, <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>.
      This should be the <m>c</m> that we seek though this is not obvious.
      Specifically, we need to show that <m>f(c)=v</m>.
      This should be where the continuity of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m> and the extra property on
      <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m> come into play.

<section xml:id="IVTandEVT-BWT">
  <title>The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem</title>
  <p>
    Once we introduced the Nested Interval Property (<xref
    ref="NIP">Axiom</xref>), the Intermediate Value Theorem (<xref
    ref="IntermediateValueTheorem">Theorem</xref>) followed pretty
    readily.  The proof of Extreme Value Theorem (<xref
    ref="thm_EVT">Theorem</xref>) takes a bit more work.  First we
    need to show that a function that satisfies the conditions of the
    EVT is bounded.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_CompactBounded">
    <statement>
      <p>
     <idx><h>continuous functions</h><h>continuous function on a closed, bounded interval is bounded</h></idx> 
     A continuous function defined on a closed, bounded interval must
     be bounded.  That is, let <m>f</m> be a continuous function
     defined on <m>[\,a,b]</m>.  Then there exists a positive real
     number <m>B</m> such that <m>|f(x)|\leq B</m> for all
     <m>x\in[\,a,b]</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    <alert>Sketch of Alleged Proof:</alert> Let's assume,
    for contradiction, that there is no such bound <m>B</m>.
    This says that for any positive integer <m>n</m>,
    there must exist <m>x_n\in[a,b]</m> such that <m>\abs{f(x_n)}>n</m>.
    (Otherwise <m>n</m> would be a bound for <m>f</m>.)
    <alert>IF</alert> the sequence <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> converged to something in <m>[\,a,b]</m>,
    say <m>c</m>, then we would have our contradiction.
    Indeed, we would have <m>\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}x_n=c</m>.
    By the continuity of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m> and <xref ref="thm_LimDefOfContinuity">Theorem</xref>
    of <xref ref="Continuity">Chapter</xref>,
    we would have <m>\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(x_n)=f(c)</m>.
    This would say that the sequence <m>\left(f(x_n)\right)</m> converges,
    so by <xref ref="lemma_BoundedConvergent">Lemma</xref>
    of <xref ref="Convergence">Chapter</xref>, it must be bounded.
    This would provide our contradiction,
    as we had <m>|f(x_n)|>n</m>, for all positive integers <m>n</m>. <alert>QED?</alert>
  </p>

  <p>
    This would all work well except for one little problem.
    The way it was constructed,
    there is no reason to expect the sequence
    <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> to converge to anything and we can't make such an assumption.
    That is why we emphasized the <alert>IF</alert> above.
    Fortunately, this idea can be salvaged.
    While it is true that the sequence
    <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> may not converge, part of it will.
    We will need the following definition.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_subsequences">
    <statement>
      <p>
            <idx><h>sequences</h><h>subsequences</h></idx>
        Let <m>\left(n_k\right)_{k=1}^\infty</m> be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers;
        that is, <m>n_1\lt n_2\lt n_3\lt \cdots</m> . If <m>\left(x_n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m>is a sequence,
        then <m>\left(x_{n_k}\right)_{k=1}^\infty=\left(x_{n_1},x_{n_2},x_{n_3},\ldots \right)</m> is called a {subsequence} of <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The idea is that a subsequence of a sequence is a part of the sequence,
    <m>(x_n)</m>, which is itself a sequence.
    However, it is a little more restrictive.
    We can choose any term in our sequence to be part of the subsequence,
    but once we choose that term, we can't go backwards.
    This is where the condition <m>n_1\lt n_2\lt n_3\lt \cdots</m> comes in.
    For example,
    suppose we started our subsequence with the term <m>x_{100}</m>.
    We could not choose our next term to be <m>x_{99}</m>.
    The subscript of the next term would have to be greater than 100.
    In fact, the thing about a subsequence is that it is all in the subscripts;
    we are really choosing a subsequence
    <m>\left(n_k\right)</m> of the sequence of subscripts
    <m>\left(n\right)</m> in <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>.

    A very important theorem about subsequences was introduced by Bernhard Bolzano 
        <idx><h>Bolzano, Bernhard</h></idx>
    and, later, independently proven 
        <idx><h>Weierstrass, Karl</h></idx>
    by Karl Weierstrass.
    Basically, this theorem says that any bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="BolzanoWeierstrass">
    <statement>
      <p>
        <alert>The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem</alert>
      </p>
      <p>
        <idx><h>Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem</h></idx>  
        Let <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> be a sequence of real numbers such
        that <m>x_n\in[\,a,b]</m>, <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>.  Then
        there exists <m>c\in[\,a,b]</m> and a subsequence
        <m>\left(x_{n_k}\right)</m>, such that
        <m>\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}x_{n_k}=c</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    As an example of this theorem, consider the sequence
    <me>
      \left((-1)^n\right)=\left(-1,1,-1,1,\ldots\right) 
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This sequence does not converge, but the subsequence
    <me>
      \left((-1)^{2k}\right)=\left(1,1,1,\ldots\right)
    </me>
    converges to <m>1</m>.
    This is not the only convergent subsequence,
    as <m>\left((-1)^{2k+1}\right)=(-1,-1,-1,\,\ldots)</m> converges to <m>-1</m>.
    Notice that if the sequence is unbounded, then all bets are off;
    the sequence may have a convergent subsequence or it may not.
    The sequences <m>\left(\left((-1)^n+1\right)n\right)</m> and
    <m>\left(n\right)</m> represent these possibilities as the first has,
    for example,
    <m>\left(\left((-1)^{2k+1}+1\right)(2k+1)\right)=(0,0,0,\,\ldots)</m> and the second one has none.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem says that no matter how <q>random</q>
    the sequence <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> may be,
    as long as it is bounded then some part of it must converge.
    This is very useful when one has some process which produces a <q>random</q>
    sequence such as what we had in the idea of the alleged proof in <xref ref="thm_CompactBounded">Theorem</xref>.
  </p>

  <proof>
<title>Sketch of a Proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem</title>
    <p>
      Suppose we have our sequence <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> such that
      <m>x_n\in[a,b]</m>, <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>.
      To find our <m>c</m> for the subsequence to converge to we will use the NIP. Since we are already using
      <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> as our original sequence,
      we will need to use different letters in setting ourselves up for the NIP. With this in mind,
      let <m>a_1=a</m> and <m>b_1=b</m>,
      and notice that <m>x_n\in[a_1,b_1]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>.
      (This is, in fact true for all <m>n</m>,
      but you'll see why we said it the way we did.)
      Let <m>m_1</m> be the midpoint of
      <m>[a_1,b_1]</m> and notice that either
      <m>x_n\in[a_1,m_1]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m> or
      <m>x_n\in[m_1,b_1]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>.
      If <m>x_n\in[a_1,m_1]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>,
      then we relabel <m>a_2=a_1</m> and <m>b_2=m_1</m>.
      If <m>x_n\in[m_1,b_1]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>,
      then relabel <m>a_2=m_1</m> and <m>b_2=b_1</m>.
      In either case, we get <m>a_1\leq a_2\leq b_2\leq b_1</m>,
      <m>b_2-a_2=\frac{1}{2}\left(b_1-a_1\right)</m>,
      and <m>x_n\in[a_2,b_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we consider the interval
      <m>[a_2,b_2]</m> and let <m>m_2</m> be the midpoint of <m>[a_2,b_2]</m>.
      Since <m>x_n\in[a_2,b_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>,
      then either <m>x_n\in[a_2,m_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m> or
      <m>x_n\in[m_2,b_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>.
      If <m>x_n\in[a_2,m_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>,
      then we relabel <m>a_3=a_2</m> and <m>b_3=m_2</m>.
      If <m>x_n\in[m_2,b_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>,
      then we relabel <m>a_3=m_2</m> and <m>b_3=b_2</m>.
      In either case,
      we get <m>a_1\leq a_2\leq a_3\leq b_3\leq b_2\leq b_1</m>,
      <m>b_3-a_3=\frac{1}{2}\left(b_2-a_2\right)=\frac{1}{2^2}\left(b_1-a_1\right)</m>,
      and <m>x_n\in[a_3,b_3]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we continue in this manner,
      we will produce two sequences <m>\left(a_k\right)</m>and
      <m>\left(b_k\right)</m> with the following properties:

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>a_1\leq a_2\leq a_3\leq\cdots</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>b_1\geq b_2\geq b_3\geq\cdots</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\forall</m> <m>k,\,a_k\leq b_k</m>
          </p>

          <p>
            <m>\displaystyle\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\left(b_k-a_k\right)=\,\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{2^{k-1}}\left(b_1-a_1\right)=0</m>

      We have our <m>c</m>.

      choose an integer <m>n_2>n_1</m> such that <m>x_{n_2}\in[a_2,b_2]</m>.
      (Notice that to make a subsequence it is crucial that <m>n_2>n_1</m>,
      and this is why we needed to insist that
      <m>x_n\in[a_2,b_2]</m> for infinitely many <m>n</m>.)
      Continuing in this manner,
      we should be able to build a subsequence

<section xml:id="IVTandEVT-SupremumAndEVT">
  <title>The Supremum and the Extreme Value Theorem</title>
  <p>
    <xref ref="thm_CompactBounded">Theorem</xref>
    says that a continuous function on a closed,
    bounded interval must be bounded.
    Boundedness, in and of itself,
    does not ensure the existence of a maximum or minimum.
    We must also have a closed, bounded interval.
    To illustrate this,
    consider the continuous function <m>f(x)=</m>tan<m>^{-1}x</m> defined on the (unbounded) interval <m>\left(-\infty,\infty\right)</m>.
  </p>

    <image width="75%" source="images/Ch6fig8.png" />

  <p>
    This function is bounded between
    <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m>and <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>,
    but it does not attain a maximum or minimum as the lines
    <m>y=\pm\frac{\pi}{2}</m> are horizontal asymptotes.
    Notice that if we restricted the domain to a closed,
    bounded interval then it would attain its extreme values on that interval
    (as guaranteed by the <term>EVT</term>).
  </p>

  <p>
    To find a maximum we need to find the smallest possible upper bound for the range of the function.
    This prompts the following definitions.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_UpperBound">
    <statement>
      <p>
            <idx><h>Upper Bound</h></idx>
        Let <m>S\subseteq\mathbb{R}</m> and let <m>b</m> be a real number.
        We say that <m>b</m> is an upper bound of
        <m>S</m> provided <m>b\geq x</m> for all <m>x\in S</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    For example, if <m>S=(0,1)</m>,
    then any <m>b</m> with <m>b\geq 1</m> would be an upper bound of <m>S</m>.
    Furthermore,
    the fact that <m>b</m> is not an element of the set <m>S</m> is immaterial.
    Indeed, if <m>T=[\,0,1]</m>,
    then any <m>b</m> with <m>b\geq 1</m> would still be an upper bound of <m>T</m>.
    Notice that, in general, if a set has an upper bound,
    then it has infinitely many since any number larger than that upper bound would also be an upper bound.
    However, there is something special about the smallest upper bound.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_LeastUpperBound"><title>Least Upper Bound Property (<term>LUBP</term>)</title>
  <idx><h>Least Upper Bound Property (LUBP)</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S\subseteq\mathbb{R}</m> and let <m>b</m> be a real
        number.  We say that <m>b</m> is the <em>least upper
        bound</em> of <m>S</m> provided
      </p>
<p>
      <ol label="(a)">
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>b\geq x</m> for all <m>x\in S</m>. (<m>b</m> is an upper bound of <m>S</m>)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              If <m>c\geq x</m> for all <m>x\in S</m>, then <m>c\geq b</m>.
              (Any upper bound of <m>S</m> is at least as big as <m>b</m>.)
            </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
</p>
      <p>
        In this case, we also say that
        <m>b</m> <em>is the supremum</em> of <m>S</m> and we write
        <me>
          b=\sup\left(S\right)
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    Notice that the definition really says that <m>b</m> is the smallest upper bound of <m>S</m>.
    Also notice that the second condition can be replaced by its contrapositive so we can say that <m>b=\sup S</m> if and only if

    <ol label="(a)">
      <li>
        <!-- <title>(i)</title> -->
        <p>
          <m>b\,\geq\,x\text{ for all } x\,\in S</m>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <!-- <title>(ii)</title> -->
        <p>
          If <m>c\,\lt \,b</m> then there exists
          <m>x\,\in S</m> such that <m>c\,\lt \,x</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    The second condition says that if a number <m>c</m> is less than <m>b</m>,
    then it can't be an upper bound,
    so that <m>b</m> really is the smallest upper bound.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also notice that the supremum of the set may or may not be in the set itself.
    This is illustrated by the examples above as in both cases,
    <m>1=\sup(0,1)</m> and <m>1=\sup [0,1]</m>.
    Obviously, a set which is not bounded above such as
    <m>\mathbb{N}=\{1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots\}</m> cannot have a supremum.
    However, for non-empty sets which are bounded above, we have the following.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_LUB"><title>The Least Upper Bound Property (<term>LUBP</term>)</title>
  <idx><h>Least Upper Bound Property (LUBP)</h></idx> 
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>S</m> be a non-empty subset of
        <m>\mathbb{R}</m> which is bounded above.
        Then <m>S</m> has a supremum.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
<title>Sketch of Proof</title>
    <p>
      Since <m>S\neq\emptyset</m>, then there exists <m>s\in S</m>.
      Since <m>S</m> is bounded above then it has an upper bound,
      say <m>b</m>.
      We will set ourselves up to use the Nested Interval Property.
      With this in mind,
      let <m>x_1=s</m> and <m>y_1=b</m> and notice that <m>\exists</m> <m>x\in S</m> such that <m>x\geq x_1</m> (namely,
      <m>x_1</m> itself) and <m>\forall\,x\in S</m>, <m>y_1\geq x</m>.
      You probably guessed what's coming next:
      let <m>m_1</m> be the midpoint of <m>[\,x_1,y_1]</m>.
      Notice that either <m>m_1\geq x,\,\forall\,x\in S</m> or <m>\exists</m> <m>x\in S</m> such that <m>x\geq m_1</m>.
      In the former case, we relabel,
      letting <m>x_2=x_1</m> and <m>y_2=m_1</m>.
      In the latter case, we let <m>x_2=m_1</m> and <m>y_2=y_1</m>.
      In either case, we end up with <m>x_1\leq x_2\leq y_2\leq y_1</m>,
      <m>y_2-x_2=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_1-x_1\right)</m>,
      and <m>\exists</m> <m>x\in S</m> such that
      <m>x\geq x_2</m> and <m>\forall\,x\in S</m>, <m>y_2\geq x</m>.
      If we continue this process, we end up with two sequences,
      <m>\left(x_n\right)</m>and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>,
      satisfying the following conditions:

      <ol>
        <li>

            <m>y_1\geq y_2\geq y_3\geq\ldots</m>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\forall</m> <m>n</m>, <m>x_n\leq y_n</m>

            <m>\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(y_n-x_n\right)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\left(y_1-x_1\right)=0</m>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\forall</m> <m>n,\exists</m> <m>x\in S</m> such that
            <m>x\geq x_n</m> and <m>\forall\,x\in S</m>, <m>y_n\geq x</m>,
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      By properties 1-5 and the NIP there exists <m>c</m> such that <m>x_n\leq c\leq y_n,\,\forall\,n</m>.
      We will leave it to you to use property 5 to show that <m>c=\sup S</m>.

    This makes sense,

<title>Sketch of Proof</title>
    <p>
      We will first show that <m>f</m> attains its maximum.
      To this end,
      recall that <xref ref="thm_CompactBounded">Theorem</xref>
      tells us that <m>f[\,a,b]=\{f(x)|\,x\in[\,a,b]\}</m> is a bounded set.
      By the LUBP, <m>f[\,a,b]</m> must have a least upper bound which we will label <m>s</m>,
      so that <m>s=\sup f[\,a,b]</m>.
      This says that <m>s\geq f(x)</m>,for all <m>x\in[\,a,b]</m>.
      All we need to do now is find a <m>c\in[\,a,b]</m> with <m>f(c)=s</m>.
      With this in mind, notice that since <m>s=\sup f[\,a,b]</m>,
      then for any positive integer <m>n</m>,
      <m>s-\frac{1}{n}</m> is not an upper bound of <m>f[\,a,b]</m>.
      Thus there exists <m>x_n\in[\,a,b]</m> with<m>\,s-\frac{1}{n}\lt f(x_n)\leq s</m>.
      Now, by the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem,
      <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> has a convergent subsequence<m>\,\left(x_{n_k}\right)</m> converging to some <m>c\in[\,a,b]</m>.
      Using the continuity of <m>f</m> at <m>c</m>,
      you should be able to show that <m>f(c)=s</m>.

    Notice that we used the NIP to prove both the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem and the LUBP. This is really unavoidable,
    as it turns out that all of those statements are equivalent in the sense that any one of them can be taken as the completeness axiom for the real number system and the others proved as theorems.
    This is not uncommon in mathematics,
    as people tend to gravitate toward ideas that suit the particular problem they are working on.
    In this case,
    people realized at some point that they needed some sort of completeness property for the real number system to prove various theorems.
    Each individual's formulation of completeness fit in with his understanding of the problem at hand.
    Only in hindsight do we see that they were really talking about the same concept:
    the completeness of the real number system.
    In point of fact,
    most modern textbooks use the LUBP as the axiom of completeness and prove all other formulations as theorems.
    We will finish this section by showing that either the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem or the LUBP can be used to prove the NIP. This says that they are all equivalent and that any one of them could be taken as the completeness axiom.

        <m>\left(x_n\right)</m> and <m>\left(y_n\right)</m>, satisfying:

        Since the LUBP is equivalent to the NIP it does not hold for the rational number system.
        Demonstrate this by finding a non-empty set of rational numbers which is bounded above,
        but whose supremum is an irrational number.

    We have the machinery in place to clean up a matter that was introduced in <xref ref="NumbersRealRational">Chapter</xref>.
    If you recall
    (or look back)
    we introduced the Archimedean Property of the real number system.
    This property says that given any two positive real numbers <m>a, b</m>,
    there exists a positive integer <m>n</m> with <m>na>b</m>.
    As we mentioned in <xref ref="NumbersRealRational">Chapter</xref>,
    this was taken to be intuitively obvious.
    The analogy we used there was to emptying an ocean <m>b</m> with a teaspoon <m>a</m> provided we are willing to use it enough times <m>n</m>.
    The completeness of the real number system allows us to prove it as a formal theorem.

        Assume that there are positive real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, such that <m>na\le b</m> <m>\forall n\in \NN</m>.

  <p>
    Given what we've been doing,
    one might ask if the Archimedean Property is equivalent to the LUBP
    (and thus could be taken as an axiom).
    The answer lies in the following problem.

        Does <m>\QQ</m> satisfy the Archimedean Property and what does this have to do with the question of taking the Archimedean Property as an axiom of completeness?
