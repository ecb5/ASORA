</h2>
<section class="introduction" id="introduction-1"><p id="p-89">The set of real numbers (denoted, <span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span>) is badly named. The real numbers are no more or less real — in the non-mathematical sense that they exist — than any other set of numbers, just like the set of rational numbers (<span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span>), the set of integers (<span class="process-math">\(\ZZ\)</span>), or the set of natural numbers (<span class="process-math">\(\NN\)</span>). The name “real numbers” is (almost) an historical anomaly not unlike the name “Pythagorean Theorem” which was actually known and understood long before Pythagoras lived.</p>
<p id="p-90">When calculus was being invented in the <span class="process-math">\(17\)</span>th century, numbers were thoroughly understood, or so it was believed.</p>
<aside class="aside aside-like" id="aside-7"><p id="p-91">Some would say “re-invented.” See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/russo96__forgot_revol.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 13">[13]</a>, or <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/netz07__archim_codex.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 9">[9]</a>.  </p></aside><p id="p-92">They were, after all, just numbers. Combine them. We call that addition. If you add them repeatedly we call it multiplication. Subtraction and division were similarly understood.</p>
<p id="p-93">It was (and still is) useful to visualize these things in a more concrete way. If we take a stick of length 2 and another of length 3 and lay them end-to-end we get a length of 5. This is addition. If we lay them end-to-end but at right angles then our two sticks are the length and width of a rectangle whose area is 6. This is multiplication.</p>
<p id="p-94">Of course measuring lengths with whole numbers has limitations, but these are not hard to fix. If we have a length (stick) of length 1 and another of length 2, then we can find another whose length when compared to 1 is the same (has the same proportion) as <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> is to <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> That number of course, is <span class="process-math">\(1/2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<figure class="figure figure-like" id="Fractions"><div class="image-box" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%;"><img src="images/Fractions.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.0.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption></figure><p id="p-95">Notice how fraction notation reflects the operation of comparing 1 to 2.  This comparison is usually referred to as the <em class="emphasis">ratio</em> of <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> so numbers of this sort are called <em class="emphasis">rational numbers.</em> The set of rational numbers is denoted <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> for quotients.  In grade school they were introduced to you as fractions.  Once fractions are understood, this visualization using line segments (sticks) leads quite naturally to their representation with the rational number line.</p>

Chief among these is that between any two points on the rational line there is another point, just as between any two rational numbers there is another rational number.</p>

<p id="p-98">This is all very clean and satisfying until we examine it just a bit closer. Then it becomes quite mysterious.

<p id="p-99">You may be wondering what we're making all of this fuss about. <em class="emphasis">Obviously</em> this is <em class="emphasis">always</em> true.

<p id="p-103"><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_CommonDenominatorsExist.html" title="Theorem 3.0.4">Theorem 3.0.4</a> suggests the following very deep and important question: Are there lengths which can <em class="emphasis">not</em> be expressed as the ratio of two integer lengths? The answer, of course, is yes. Otherwise we wouldn't have asked the question. Notice that for such numbers our proof of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_CommonDenominatorsExist.html" title="Theorem 3.0.4">Theorem 3.0.4</a> is not valid (why not?).</p>
<p id="p-104">One of the best known examples of such a number is the circumference of a circle with diameter 1. This is the number usually denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{.}\)</span> But circles are extremely complex objects — they only seem simple because they are so familiar. Arising as it does from a circle, you would expect the number <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> to be very complex as well and this is true. In fact <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> is an exceptionally weird number for a variety of reasons. Let's start with something a little easier to think about.</p>
<p id="p-105">Squares are simple. Two sets of parallel lines at right angles, all of the same length. What could be simpler? If we construct a square with sides having length 1 then its diagonal has length <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</span></p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.0.6<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>A construction of <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span></figcaption></figure><p id="p-106"> This is a number which cannot be expressed as the <em class="emphasis">ratio</em> of two integers.  That is, it is <em class="emphasis">irrational.</em> This has been known since ancient times, but it is still quite disconcerting when first encountered.  It seems so counter-intuitive that the intellect rebels.  “This can't be right,” it says. “That's just crazy!”</p>
<p id="p-107">Nevertheless it is true and we can prove it is true as follows.</p>
<p id="p-108">What happens if we suppose that the square root of two <em class="emphasis">can</em> be expressed as a ratio of integers? We will show that this leads irrevocably to a conclusion that is manifestly not true.</p>
<p id="p-109">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}=a/b\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are integers. Suppose further that the fraction <span class="process-math">\(a/b\)</span> is in lowest terms. <em class="emphasis">This assumption is crucial because if <span class="process-math">\(a/b\)</span> is in lowest terms we know that at most only one of them is even.</em></p>
<p id="p-110">So</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="" id="md-3">
\begin{align*}
\frac{a}{b} \amp = \sqrt{2}.\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">Squaring both sides gives:</p>
\begin{align*}
a^2 \amp = 2b^2.\\
\end{align*}
<p class="intertext">Therefore <span class="process-math">\(a^2\)</span> is even. But if <span class="process-math">\(a^2\)</span> is even then <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> must be even also (why?). If <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is even then <span class="process-math">\(a=2k\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Therefore</p>
\begin{align*}
4k^2\amp =2b^2\textit{ or}\\
2k^2\amp = b^2\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p id="p-111">Therefore <span class="process-math">\(b^2\)</span> is also even and so <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> must be even too. But this is impossible. We've just concluded that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are both even and this conclusion follows directly from our initial assumption that at most one of them could be even.</p>
<p id="p-112">This is nonsense. Where is our error? It is not in any single step of our reasoning. That was all solid. Check it again to be sure.</p>
<p id="p-113">Therefore our error must be in the initial assumption that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> could be expressed as a fraction. That assumption must therefore be false. In other words, <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> cannot be so expressed.</p>

<p id="p-120"> The fact that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is not rational is cute and interesting, but unless, like the Pythagoreans of ancient Greece, you have a strongly held religious conviction that all numbers are rational, it does not seem terribly important. On the other hand, the very existence of <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> raises some interesting questions. For example what can the symbol <span class="process-math">\(4^{\sqrt{2}}\)</span> possibly mean? If the exponent were a rational number, say <span class="process-math">\(m/n\text{,}\)</span> then clearly <span class="process-math">\(4^{m/n}=\sqrt[n]{4^m}\text{.}\)</span> But since <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\neq m/n\)</span> for <em class="emphasis">any</em> integers <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> how do we interpret <span class="process-math">\(4^{\sqrt{2}}?\)</span> Does it have any meaning at all? The more you think about this, the more puzzling the existence of irrational numbers becomes. Suppose for example we reconsider the construction of a line segment of length <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</span> It is clear that the construction works and that we really can build such a line segment. It exists.</p>
<p id="p-121">Repeat the construction but this time let's put the base side on the rational line.</p>

<p id="p-128">Recall that between any two rational numbers there is always another. This fact is what led us to represent the rational numbers with a line in the first place.</p>
<p id="p-129">But it's even worse than that. It's straightforward to show that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{3}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{5}\text{,}\)</span> etc. are all irrational too.

<p id="p-137">This is such an intuitively straightforward concept that it is easy to accept it without proof. Until the invention of calculus, and even for some time after that, it was simply assumed. However as the foundational problems posed by the concepts of calculus were understood and solved we were eventually led to a deeper understanding of the complexities of the real number system. The Archimedean Property is no longer taken as an unproved axiom, but rather it is now understood to be a consequence of other axioms. We will show this later, but for now we will accept it as obviously true just as Archimedes did.</p>
<p id="p-138">With the invention of calculus, mathematicians of the seventeenth century began to use objects which didn't satisfy the Archimedean Property (in fact, so did Archimedes). As we shall see in the next chapter, when Leibniz wrote the first paper on his version of the calculus, he followed this practice by explicitly laying out rules for manipulating infinitely small quantities (infinitesimals). These were taken to be actual numbers which are not zero and yet smaller than any real number. The notation he used was <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ x}\)</span> (an infinitely small displacement in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> direction), and <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ y}\)</span> (an infinitely small displacement in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> direction). These symbols should look familiar to you. They are the same <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ y}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ x}\)</span> used to form the derivative symbol <span class="process-math">\(\dfdx{y}{x}\)</span> that you learned about in calculus.</p>
<p id="p-139">Mathematicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries made amazing scientific and mathematical progress exploiting these infinitesimals, even though they were foundationally suspect. No matter how many times you add the infinitesimal <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ x}\)</span> to itself the result will not be bigger than, say <span class="process-math">\(10^{-1000}\text{,}\)</span> which is very bizarre.</p>
<p id="p-140">When foundational issues came to the forefront, infinitesimals fell somewhat out of favor. You probably didn't use them very much in calculus. Most of the time you probably used the prime notation, <span class="process-math">\(f^\prime(x)\)</span> introduced by Lagrange  in the eighteenth century. Some of the themes in this book are: Why differentials fell out of favor, what were they replaced with and how the modern notations you learned in calculus evolved over time.</p>
<p id="p-141">To conclude this aside on the Archimedean Property, the idea of infinitesimals was revisited in the twentieth century by the logician Abraham Robinson in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/robinson74__non_stand_analy.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 12">[12]</a>. Robinson was able to put the idea of infinitesimals on a solid logical foundation. But in the 18th century, the existence of infinitesimal numbers was shaky to say the very least. However this did not prevent mathematicians from successfully exploiting these infinitely small quantities.</p>

<p id="p-149">Use the result of part (a) to prove <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_IrrationalBetweenIrrationals.html" title="Theorem 3.0.11">Theorem 3.0.11</a>.</p></article></article></div>
<p id="p-150">As a practical matter, the existence of irrational numbers isn't really very important. In light of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_IrrationalBetweenIrrationals.html" title="Theorem 3.0.11">Theorem 3.0.11</a>, any irrational number can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a rational number. So if we're designing a bridge and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is needed we just use <span class="process-math">\(1.414\)</span> instead. The error introduced is less than <span class="process-math">\(0.001 =1/1000\)</span> so it probably doesn't matter.</p>
<p id="p-151">But from a theoretical point of view this is devastating. When calculus was invented, the rational numbers were suddenly not up to the task of justifying the concepts and operations we needed to work with.</p>
<p id="p-152">Newton explicitly founded his version of calculus on the assumption that we can think of variable quantities as being generated by a continuous motion. If our number system has holes in it such continuous motion is impossible because we have no way to jump over the gaps. So Newton simply postulated that there were no holes. He filled in the hole where <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> should be. He simply said, yes there is a number there called <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> and he did the same with all of the other holes.</p>
<p id="p-153">To be sure there is no record of Newton explicitly saying, “Here's how I'm going to fill in the holes in the rational number line.” Along with everyone else at the time, he simply assumed there were no holes and moved on. It took about <span class="process-math">\(200\)</span> years of puzzling and arguing over the contradictions, anomalies and paradoxes to work out the consequences of that apparently simple assumption. The task may not yet be fully accomplished, but by the 20th century the properties of the real number system (<span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span>) as an extension of the rational number system (<span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span>) were well understood. Here are both systems visualized as lines:</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like" id="RandQ"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="images/RandQ.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">3.0.14<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span><span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span></figcaption></figure><p id="p-154">Impressive, no?</p>
<p id="p-155">The reason they look alike, except for the labels <span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> of course, is that our ability to draw sketches of the objects we're studying utterly fails when we try to sketch <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{,}\)</span> as different from <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\text{.}\)</span> All of the holes in <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> really are there, but the non-holes are packed together so closely that we can't separate them in a drawing. This inability to sketch the objects we study will be a frequent source of frustration.</p>
<p id="p-156">Of course, this will not stop us from drawing sketches. When we do, our imaginations will save us because it <em class="emphasis">is</em> possible to <em class="emphasis">imagine</em> <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> as distinct from <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{.}\)</span> But put away the idea that a sketch is an accurate representation of anything. At best our sketches will only be aids to the imagination.</p>
<p id="p-157">So, at this point we will simply assume the existence of the real numbers. We will assume also that they have all of the properties that we are used to. This is perfectly acceptable as long as we make our assumptions explicit. However we need to be aware that, so far, the existence and properties of the real numbers is an <em class="emphasis">assumption</em> that has not been logically derived. Any time we make an assumption we need to be prepared to either abandon it completely if we find that it leads to nonsensical results, or to re-examine the assumption in the light of these results to see if we can find another assumption that subsumes the first and explains the (apparently) nonsensical results.</p></section><nav class="summary-links"><ul><li><a href="NumbersRealRational-AddProbs.html" class="internal"><span class="codenumber">3.1</span> <span class="title">Additional Problems</span></a></li></ul></nav></section></div></main>
