</h2>
<section class="introduction" id="introduction-34"><p id="p-1530">Contrary to the title of this section we will not be rigorously building the real numbers here. Instead our goal is to show why such a build is logically necessary, and to give a sense of some of the ways this has been accomplished in the past. This may seem odd given our uniform emphasis on mathematical rigor, especially in the third part of the text, but there are very good reasons for this.</p>
<p id="p-1531">One is simple practicality. The fact is that rigorously building the real numbers and then showing that they have the required properties is extraordinarily detailed work, even for mathematics. If we want to keep this text to a manageable size (we do), we simply don't have the room.</p>
<p id="p-1532">The second reason is that there is, as far as we know, very little for you to gain by it. When we are done we will have the real numbers. The same real numbers you have been using all of your life. They have the same properties, and quirks, they've always had. To be sure, they will not have lost any of their charm; They will be the same delightful mix of the mundane and the bizarre, and they are still well worth exploring and getting to know better. But nothing we do in the course of building them up logically from simpler ideas will help with that exploration.</p>
<p id="p-1533">A reasonable question then, is, “Why bother?” If the process is overwhelmingly, tediously detailed (it is) and gives us nothing new for our efforts, why do it at all?</p>
<aside class="aside aside-like" id="aside-23"><p id="p-1534">By Andrew Wiles, the man who proved Fermat's Last Theorem.</p></aside><p id="p-1535">Doing mathematics has been compared to entering a dark room.  At first you are lost.  The layout of the room and furniture are unknown so you fumble about for a bit and slowly get a sense of your immediate environs, perhaps a vague notion of the organization of the room as a whole.  Eventually, after much, often tedious exploration, you become quite comfortable in your room.  But always there will be dark corners; hidden areas you have not yet explored.  Such a dark area may hide anything; the latches to unopened doors you didn't know were there; a clamp whose presence explains why you couldn't move that little desk in the corner; even the light switch that would allow you to illuminate an area more clearly than you would have imagined possible.</p>
<p id="p-1536">But, and this is the point, there is no way to know what you will find there until you walk into that dark corner and begin exploring.  Perhaps nothing.  But perhaps something wonderful.</p>
<p id="p-1537">This is what happened in the late nineteenth century.  The real numbers had been used since the Pythagoreans learned that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> was irrational.  But really, most calculuations were (and still are) done with just the rational numbers. Moreover, since <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> forms a “set of measure zero,”  it is clear that most of the real numbers had gone completely unused. The set of real numbers was thus one of those “dark corners” of mathematics. It had to be explored.</p>
<aside class="aside aside-like" id="aside-24"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Measure Zero Sets.</span></h3>
<p id="p-1538">See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cor_Q-MeasureZero.html" title="Corollary 12.1.10">Corollary 12.1.10</a> of <a href="BackToFourier.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 12: Back to the Real Numbers">Chapter 12</a>.</p></aside><p id="p-1539">“But even if that is true,” you might ask, ``I have no interest in the logical foundations of the real numbers, especially if such knowledge won't tell me anything I don't already know. Why do I need to know all of the details of constructing <span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\QQ?\)</span></p>
<p id="p-1540">The answer to this is very simple: You don't.</p>
<p id="p-1541">That's the other reason we're not covering all of the details of this material. We will explain enough to light up, dimly perhaps, this little corner of mathematics. Later, should you need (or want) to come back to this and explore further you will have a foundation to start with. Nothing more.</p>
<p id="p-1542">Until the nineteenth century the geometry of Euclid, as given in his book <em class="emphasis">The Elements,</em> was universally regarded as the touchstone of mathematical perfection. This belief was so deeply embedded in Western culture that as recently as 1923, Edna St. Vincent Millay opened one of the poems in her book <em class="emphasis">The Harp Weaver and Other Poems</em> with the line “Euclid alone has looked on beauty bare.”</p>
<p id="p-1543">Euclid begins his book by stating <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> simple axioms and proceeds, step by logical step, to build up his geometry. Although far from actual perfection, his methods are clean, precise and efficient — he arrives at the Pythagorean Theorem in only <span class="process-math">\(47\)</span> steps (theorems) — and even today Euclid's <em class="emphasis">Elements</em> still sets a very high standard of mathematical exposition and parsimony.</p>
<p id="p-1544">The goal of starting with what is clear and simple and proceeding logically, rigorously, to what is complex is still a guiding principle of all mathematics for a variety of reasons. In the late nineteenth century, this principle was brought to bear on the real numbers. That is, some properties of the real numbers that at first seem simple and intuitively clear turn out on closer examination, as we have seen, to be rather counter-intuitive. This alone is not really a problem. We can have counter-intuitive properties in our mathematics — indeed, this is a big part of what makes mathematics interesting — as long as we arrive at them logically, starting from simple assumptions the same way Euclid did.</p>
<p id="p-1545">Having arrived at a view of the real numbers which is comparable to that of our nineteenth century colleagues, it should now be clear that the real numbers and their properties must be built up from simpler concepts as suggested by our Italian friends in the previous section.</p>
<p id="p-1546">In addition to those properties we have discovered so far, both <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span> share another property which will be useful. We have used it throughout this text but have not heretofore made it explicit. They are both <em class="emphasis">linearly ordered.</em> We will now make this property explicit.</p>

<p id="p-1565">In a thorough, rigorous presentation we would now assume the existence of the natural numbers <span class="process-math">\((\NN)\text{,}\)</span> and their properties and use these to define the integers, <span class="process-math">\((\ZZ)\text{.}\)</span> We would then use the integers to define the rational numbers, <span class="process-math">\((\QQ)\text{.}\)</span> We could then show that the rationals satisfy the field axioms worked out in the previous section, and that they are linearly ordered.</p>

<p id="p-1567">We would start with the natural numbers because they seem to be simple enough that we can simply assume their properties. As Leopold Kronecker (1823-1891) said: “God made the natural numbers, all else is the work of man.”</p>
<p id="p-1568">Unfortunately this is rather a lot to fit into this epilogue so we will have to abbreviate the process rather severely.</p>
<p id="p-1569">We will assume the existence and properties of the rational numbers.

But the level of detail required for rigor quickly becomes onerous.</p>
<p id="p-1570">Even starting at this fairly advanced position in the chain of logic there is still a considerable level of detail needed to complete the process. Therefore our exposition will necessarily be incomplete.</p>
<p id="p-1571">Rather than display, in full rigor, how the real numbers can be built up from the rationals we will show, in fairly broad terms, three ways this has been done in the past.

<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">13.2.1</span> <span class="title">The Decimal Expansion</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-1572">This is by far the most straightforward method we will examine. Since we begin with <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\text{,}\)</span> we already have some numbers whose decimal expansion is infinite. For example, <span class="process-math">\(\frac13= 0.333\ldots\text{.}\)</span> We also know that if <span class="process-math">\(x\in\QQ\)</span> then expressing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as a decimal gives either a finite or a <em class="emphasis">repeating infinite</em> decimal.</p>
<p id="p-1573">More simply, we can say that <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> consists of the set of all decimal expressions which eventually repeat. (If it eventually repeats zeros then it is what we've called a finite decimal.)</p>
<p id="p-1574">We then define the real numbers to be the set of all infinite decimals, repeating or not.</p>
<p id="p-1575">It may feel as if all we have to do is define addition and multiplication in the obvious fashion and we are finished. This set with these definitions obviously satisfy all of the field axioms worked out by our Italian friends in the previous section. Moreover it seems clear that all of our equivalent completeness axioms are satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-1576">However, things are not quite as clear cut as they seem.</p>
<p id="p-1577">The primary difficulty in this approach is that the decimal representation of the real numbers is so familiar that everything we need to show <em class="emphasis">seems</em> obvious. But stop and think for a moment. Is it really obvious how to define addition and multiplication of <em class="emphasis">infinite</em> decimals? Consider the addition algorithm we were all taught in grade school. That algorithm requires that we line up two numbers at their decimal points:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="" id="md-56">
\begin{align*}
d_1d_2\amp .d_3d_4\\
+\   \delta_1\delta_2\amp .\delta_3\delta_4\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p id="p-1578">We then begin adding in the rightmost column and proceed to the left. <em class="emphasis">But if our decimals are infinite we can't get started because there is no rightmost column!</em></p>
<p id="p-1579">A similar problem occurs with multiplication.</p>
<p id="p-1580">So our first problem is to define addition and multiplication in <span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span> in a manner that re-captures addition and multiplication in <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-1581">This is not a trivial task.</p>
<p id="p-1582">One way to proceed is to recognize that the decimal notation we've used all of our lives is really shorthand for the sum of an infinite series. That is, if <span class="process-math">\(x=0.d_1d_2d_3\ldots\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(0\leq d_i\leq 9\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(i\in\NN\)</span> then</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{d_i}{10^i}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p id="p-1583">Addition is now apparently easy to define: If <span class="process-math">\(x=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{d_i}{10^i}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{\delta_i}{10^i}\)</span> then</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x+y= \sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{e_i}{10^i} \text{ where \(e_i =d_i+\delta_i\). }
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p id="p-1584">But there is a problem. Suppose for some <span class="process-math">\(j\in\NN\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(e_j=d_j+\delta_j&gt;10\text{.}\)</span> In that case our sum does not satisfy the condition <span class="process-math">\(0\leq e_j\leq 9\)</span> so it is not even clear that the expression <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{j=1}^\infty\frac{e_j}{10^j}\)</span> represents a real number. That is, we may not have the closure property of a number field. We will have to define some sort of “carrying” operation to handle this.</p>

<p id="p-1587">A similar difficulty arises when we try to define multiplication. Once we have a notion of carrying in place, we could define multiplication as just the multiplication of series. Specifically, we could define</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="" id="md-57">
\begin{align*}
(0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots)\cdot(0.b_1b_2b_3\ldots) \amp =\left(\frac{a_1}{10}+\frac{a_2}{10^2}+\cdots\right) \cdot\left(\frac{b_1}{10}+\frac{b_2}{10^2}+\cdots\right)\\
\amp =\frac{a_1b_1}{10^2}+\frac{a_1b_2+a_2b_1}{10^3}+\frac{a_1b_3+a_2b_2+a_3b_1}{10^4}+\cdots\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p id="p-1588">We could then convert this to a “proper” decimal using our carrying operation.</p>
<p id="p-1589">Again the devil is in the details to show that such algebraic operations satisfy everything we want them to. Even then, we need to worry about linearly ordering these numbers and our completeness axiom.</p>
<p id="p-1590">Another way of looking at this is to think of an infinite decimal representation as a (Cauchy) sequence of finite decimal approximations. Since we know how to add and multiply finite decimal representations, we can just add and multiply the individual terms in the sequences. Of course, there is no reason to restrict ourselves to only these specific types of Cauchy sequences, as we see in our next approach.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="CauchySequences"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">13.2.2</span> <span class="title">Cauchy Sequences</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-1591">As we've seen, Georg Cantor  began his career studying Fourier series and quickly moved on to more foundational matters in the theory of infinite sets.</p>
<p id="p-1592">But he did not lose his fascination with real analysis when he moved on. Like many mathematicians of his time, he realized the need to build <span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\text{.}\)</span> He and his friend and mentor Richard Dedekind  (who's approach we will see in the next section) both found different ways to build <span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-1593">Cantor started with Cauchy sequences in <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-1594">That is, we consider the set of all Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. We would like to <em class="emphasis">define</em> each such sequence to be a real number. The goal should be clear. If <span class="process-math">\(\left(s_n\right)_{n=1}^\infty\)</span> is a sequence in <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> which converges to <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> then we will call <span class="process-math">\(\left(s_n\right)\)</span> the real number <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-1595">This probably seems a bit startling at first. There are a <em class="emphasis">lot</em> of numbers in <span class="process-math">\(\left(s_n\right)\)</span> (countably infinitely many, to be precise) and we are proposing putting all of them into a big bag, tying it up in a ribbon, and calling the whole thing <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</span> It seems a very odd thing to propose, but recall from the discussion in the previous section that we left the concept of “number” undefined. Thus if we can take <em class="emphasis">any</em> set of objects and define addition and multiplication in such a way that the field axioms are satisfied, then those objects are legitimately numbers. To show that they are, in fact, the <em class="emphasis">real</em> numbers we will also need the completeness property.</p>
<p id="p-1596">A bag full of rational numbers works as well as anything <em class="emphasis">if</em> we can define addition and multiplication appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-1597">Our immediate problem though is not addition or multiplication but uniqueness. If we take one sequence <span class="process-math">\(\left(s_n\right)\)</span> which converges to <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> and define it to be <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> what will we do with all of the other sequences that converge to <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}?\)</span></p>
<p id="p-1598">Also, we have to be careful not to refer to any real numbers, like the square root of two for example, as we define the real numbers. This would be a circular — and thus useless — definition. Obviously though, we can refer to <em class="emphasis">rational</em> numbers, since these are the tools we'll be using.</p>
<p id="p-1599">The solution is clear. We take <em class="emphasis">all</em> sequences of rational numbers that converge to <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{,}\)</span> throw them into our bag and call <em class="emphasis">that</em> <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</span> Our bag is getting pretty full now.</p>
<p id="p-1600">But we need to do this without using <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> because it is a real number. The following two definitions satisfy all of our needs.</p>

<p id="p-1627">However this does not necessarily show that they form <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{.}\)</span>  We also need to show that they are complete in the sense of <a href="IVTandEVT.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 10: Intermediate and Extreme Values">Chapter 10</a>.  It is perhaps not too surprising that when we build the real numbers using equivalent Cauchy sequences the most natural completeness property we can show is that if a sequence of real numbers is Cauchy then it converges.</p>
<p id="p-1628">However we are not in a position to show that Cauchy sequences in <span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span> converge.  To do this we would first need to show that these sets of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (real numbers) are linearly ordered.</p>
<p id="p-1629">Unfortunately showing the linear ordering, while not especially hard, is time consuming. So we will again invoke the prerogatives of the teacher and brush all of the difficulties aside with the assertion that it is straightforward to show that the real numbers as we have constructed them in this section are linearly ordered and are complete. If you would like to see this construction in full rigor we recommend the book, <em class="emphasis">The Number System</em> by H. A. Thurston <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thurston56__number_system.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 16">[16]</a>.</p>

<p id="p-1631">An advantage of building the reals via Cauchy sequences in the previous section is that once we've identified equivalent sequences with real numbers it is <em class="emphasis">very</em> clear how addition and multiplication should be defined.</p>
<p id="p-1632">On the other hand, before we can even start to understand that construction, we need a fairly strong sense of what it means for a sequence to converge and enough experience with sequences to be comfortable with the notion of a Cauchy sequence. Thus a good deal of high level mathematics must be mastered before we can even begin.</p>
<p id="p-1633">The method of “Dedekind cuts” first developed by Richard Dedekind  (though he just called them “cuts”) in his 1872 book, <em class="emphasis">Continuity and the Irrational Numbers</em> shares the advantage of the Cauchy sequence method in that, once the candidates for the real numbers have been identified, it is very clear how addition and multiplication should be defined. It is also straightforward to show that most of the field axioms are satisfied.</p>
<aside class="aside aside-like" id="aside-27"><p id="p-1634">“Clear” does not mean “easy to do” as we will see.</p></aside><p id="p-1635">In addition, Dedekind's method also has the advantage that very little mathematical knowledge is required to get started. This is intentional. In the preface to the first edition of his book, Dedekind  states:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="blockquote-5"><p id="p-1636">This memoir can be understood by anyone possessing what is usually called common sense; no technical philosophic, or mathematical, knowledge is in the least degree required. (quoted in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/hawking05__god_creat_integ.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 5">[5]</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p id="p-1637">While he may have overstated his case a bit, it is clear that his intention was to argue from very simple first principles just as Euclid did.</p>
<p id="p-1638">His starting point was the observation we made in <a href="NumbersRealRational.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Numbers, Real (\RR) and Rational (\QQ)">Chapter 3</a>: The rational number line is full of holes. More precisely we can “cut” the rational line in two distinct ways:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-138"><p id="p-1639">We can pick a rational number, <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span> This choice divides all other rational numbers into two classes: Those greater than <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and those less than <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li id="li-139"><p id="p-1640">We can pick one of the holes in the rational number line. In this case <em class="emphasis">all</em> of the rationals fall into two classes: Those greater than the hole and those less.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-1641">But to speak of rational numbers as less than or greater than something that is <em class="emphasis">not</em> there is utter nonsense. We'll need a better (that is, a rigorous) definition.</p>
<p id="p-1642">As before we will develop an overall sense of this construction rather than a fully detailed presentation, as the latter would be far too long to include.</p>
<p id="p-1643">Our presentation will closely follow that of Edmund Landau's in his classic 1951 text <em class="emphasis">Foundations of Analysis</em> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/landau66__found_analy.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 7">[7]</a>.

We quote from Landau <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/landau66__found_analy.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 7">[7]</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" id="blockquote-7">
<p id="p-1692">These cuts will henceforth be called the “positive numbers;”  .  .  .</p>
<p id="p-1693">We create a new number <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> (to be read “zero”), distinct from the positive numbers.</p>
<p id="p-1694">We also create numbers which are distinct from the positive numbers as well as distinct from zero, and which we will call negative numbers, in such a way that to each <span class="process-math">\(\xi\)</span> (I.e. to each positive number) we assign a negative number denoted by <span class="process-math">\(-\xi\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(-\)</span> to be read “minus”).

<p id="p-1695">The totality consisting of all positive numbers, of <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> and of all negative numbers, will be called the real numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p-1696">Of course it is not nearly enough to simply postulate the existence of the non-negative real numbers.</p>
<p id="p-1697">All we have so far is a set of objects we're calling the real numbers.  For some of them (the positive reals -- that is, the cuts) we have defined addition and multiplication. These definitions will eventually turn out to correspond to the addition and multiplication we are familiar with.</p>
<p id="p-1698">However we do not have either operation for our entire set of proposed real numbers. Before we do this we need first to define the <em class="emphasis">absolute value</em> of a real number.
