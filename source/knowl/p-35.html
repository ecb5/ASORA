<p>Perhaps you haven't been able to fill in the details on your own. That's ok. Many people can't. If not then get help: from a classmate, a friend, your instructor, whomever. Unfortunately most people won't get help in this situation. Instead they will perceive this as “failure,” hide it and berate themselves or the problem as “stupid.” In short they will let their personal insecurities and demons overwhelm them. <em class="emphasis">Don't do this. Get help.</em> You are neither dumb nor incapable. There are a thousand reasons that on any given day you might not be able to solve this problem. But don't let a bad day interfere with the education you are here for. Get someone to help you over this hump. Later you will be able to help your helper in the same way. Really.</p>
