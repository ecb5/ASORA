<p>This probably seems a bit startling at first. There are a <em class="emphasis">lot</em> of numbers in <span class="process-math">\(\left(s_n\right)\)</span> (countably infinitely many, to be precise) and we are proposing putting all of them into a big bag, tying it up in a ribbon, and calling the whole thing <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</span> It seems a very odd thing to propose, but recall from the discussion in the previous section that we left the concept of “number” undefined. Thus if we can take <em class="emphasis">any</em> set of objects and define addition and multiplication in such a way that the field axioms are satisfied, then those objects are legitimately numbers. To show that they are, in fact, the <em class="emphasis">real</em> numbers we will also need the completeness property.</p>
