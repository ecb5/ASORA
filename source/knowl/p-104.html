<p>One of the best known examples of such a number is the circumference of a circle with diameter 1. This is the number usually denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{.}\)</span> But circles are extremely complex objects â€” they only seem simple because they are so familiar. Arising as it does from a circle, you would expect the number <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> to be very complex as well and this is true. In fact <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> is an exceptionally weird number for a variety of reasons. Let's start with something a little easier to think about.</p>
