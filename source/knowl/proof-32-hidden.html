<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>For the sake of obtaining a contradiction assume that the sequence <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> contains every real number; that is, <span class="process-math">\(S=\RR\text{.}\)</span> As usual we will build a sequence of nested intervals <span class="process-math">\(\left(\left[x_i, y_i\right]\right)_{i=1}^\infty\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> be the smaller of the first two distinct elements of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(y_1\)</span> be the larger and take <span class="process-math">\(\left[x_1,y_1\right]\)</span> to be the first interval.</p>
<p>Next we assume that <span class="process-math">\(\left[x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right]\)</span> has been constructed and build <span class="process-math">\(\left[x_n, y_n\right]\)</span> as follows. Observe that there are infinitely many elements of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right)\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(S=\RR\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(s_m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s_k\)</span> be the <em class="emphasis">first</em> two distinct elements of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> such that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
s_m, s_k \in \left(x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}\right) \text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Take <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> to be the smaller and <span class="process-math">\(y_n\)</span> to be the larger of <span class="process-math">\(s_m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s_k\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\left[x_n, y_n\right]\)</span> is the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th interval.</p>
<p>From the way we constructed them it is clear that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\left[x_1, y_1\right] \supseteq \left[x_2, y_2\right] \supseteq \left[x_3, y_3\right] \supseteq \ldots\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_WeakNIP.html" title="Theorem 12.1.1">Theorem 12.1.1</a> there is a real number, say <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> such that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/thm_WeakNIP.html">
\begin{equation*}
c\in\left[x_n, y_n\right] \text{ for all }  n\in\NN\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In fact, since <span class="process-math">\(x_1\lt x_2\lt x_3\ldots\lt y_3\lt y_2\lt y_1\)</span> it is clear that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
x_n\lt c\lt y_n, \ \forall n\text{.}\tag{12.1.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>We will show that <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is the number we seek. That the inequalities in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_NIP-interval.html" title="Equation 12.1.1">formula (12.1.1)</a> are strict will play a crucial role.</p>
<p>To see that <span class="process-math">\(c\not\in S\)</span> we suppose that <span class="process-math">\(c\in S\)</span> and derive a contradiction.</p>
<p>So, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(c=s_p\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(p\in\NN\text{.}\)</span> Then only <span class="process-math">\(\left\{s_1, s_2,\ldots,
s_{p-1}\right\}\)</span> appear before <span class="process-math">\(s_p\)</span> in the sequence <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Since each <span class="process-math">\(x_n\)</span> is taken from <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> it follows that only finitely many elements of the sequence <span class="process-math">\((x_n)\)</span> appear before <span class="process-math">\(s_p=c\)</span> in the sequence as well.</p>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(x_l\)</span> be the <em class="emphasis">last</em> element of <span class="process-math">\((x_n)\)</span> which appears before <span class="process-math">\(c=s_p\)</span> in the sequence and consider <span class="process-math">\(x_{l+1}\text{.}\)</span> The way it was constructed, <span class="process-math">\(x_{l+1}\)</span> was one of the first two distinct terms in the sequence <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> strictly between <span class="process-math">\(x_l\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y_l\text{,}\)</span> the other being <span class="process-math">\(y_{l+1}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x_{l+1}\)</span> does not appear before <span class="process-math">\(c=s_p\)</span> in the sequence and <span class="process-math">\(x_l\lt c\lt y_l\text{,}\)</span> it follows that either <span class="process-math">\(c=x_{l+1}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(c=y_{l+1}\text{.}\)</span> However, this gives us a contradiction as we know from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_NIP-interval.html" title="Equation 12.1.1">formula (12.1.1)</a> that <span class="process-math">\(x_{l+1}\lt c\lt y_{l+1}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Thus <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is not an element of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span></p></article></body>
