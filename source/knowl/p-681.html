<p>This is <em class="emphasis">not</em> Lagrange's proof.  He did not use the integral form of the remainder.  However, this is similar to Lagrange's proof in that he also used the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)  and Extreme Value Theorem (EVT)  much as we did.  In Lagrange's day, these were taken to be obviously true for a continuous function and we have followed Lagrange's  lead by assuming the IVT and the EVT. However, in mathematics we need to keep our assumptions few and simple.  The IVT and the EVT do not satisfy this need in the sense that both can be proved from simpler ideas.  We will return to this in <a href="IVTandEVT.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 10: Intermediate and Extreme Values">ChapterÂ 10</a>.</p>
