<p>The idea is that a subsequence of a sequence is a part of the sequence, <span class="process-math">\((x_n)\text{,}\)</span> which is itself a sequence. However, it is a little more restrictive. We can choose any term in our sequence to be part of the subsequence, but once we choose that term, we can't go backwards. This is where the condition <span class="process-math">\(n_1\lt n_2\lt n_3\lt \cdots\)</span> comes in. For example, suppose we started our subsequence with the term <span class="process-math">\(x_{100}\text{.}\)</span> We could not choose our next term to be <span class="process-math">\(x_{99}\text{.}\)</span> The subscript of the next term would have to be greater than 100. In fact, the thing about a subsequence is that it is all in the subscripts; we are really choosing a subsequence <span class="process-math">\(\left(n_k\right)\)</span> of the sequence of subscripts <span class="process-math">\(\left(n\right)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\left(x_n\right)\text{.}\)</span></p>
