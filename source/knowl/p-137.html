<p>This is such an intuitively straightforward concept that it is easy to accept it without proof. Until the invention of calculus, and even for some time after that, it was simply assumed. However as the foundational problems posed by the concepts of calculus were understood and solved we were eventually led to a deeper understanding of the complexities of the real number system. The Archimedean Property is no longer taken as an unproved axiom, but rather it is now understood to be a consequence of other axioms. We will show this later, but for now we will accept it as obviously true just as Archimedes did.</p>
