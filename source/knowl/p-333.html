<p>A few comments about <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/TaylorSeriesThm.html" title="Theorem 5.1.1">TheoremÂ 5.1.1</a> are in order. Notice that we did <em class="emphasis">not</em> start with a function and derive its series representation. Instead we <em class="emphasis">defined</em> <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> to be the series we wrote down. This assumes that the expression <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x-a)^n\)</span> actually has meaning (that it converges). At this point we have every reason to expect that it does, however expectation is not proof so we note that this is an assumption, not an established truth. Similarly, the idea that we can differentiate an infinite polynomial term-by-term as we would a finite polynomial is also assumed. As before, we follow in the footsteps of our 18th century forebears in making these assumptions. For now.</p>
