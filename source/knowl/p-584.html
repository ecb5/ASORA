<p>This is what happened with the words “open” and “closed.” These are opposites in English: “not open” is “closed,” “not closed” is “open,” and there is nothing which is both open and closed. But recall that an open interval on the real line, <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\text{,}\)</span> is one that does not include <em class="emphasis">either</em> of its endpoints while a closed interval, <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{,}\)</span> is one that includes both of them.</p>
