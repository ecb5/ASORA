<p>Before we tackle the IVT and EVT, let's use the NIP to address an interesting question about the Harmonic Series.  Recall that the Harmonic Series, <span class="process-math">\(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\cdots\text{,}\)</span> grows without bound, that is, <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}=\infty\text{.}\)</span>  The question is how slowly does this series grow?  For example, how many terms would it take before the series surpasses 100? 1000? 10000?  Leonhard Euler  decided to tackle this problem in the following way.  Euler decided to consider the <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+
\frac{1}{n}\right)-\text{ ln } \left(n+1\right)\right)\text{.}\)</span>  This limit is called Euler's constant and is denoted by <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{.}\)</span> This says that for <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> large, we have <span class="process-math">\(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\approx\)</span>ln<span class="process-math">\(\left(n+1\right)+\gamma\text{.}\)</span> If we could approximate <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{,}\)</span> then we could replace the inequality <span class="process-math">\(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\geq
100\)</span> with the more tractable inequality ln<span class="process-math">\(\left(n+1\right)+\gamma\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\geq 0\)</span> and solve for <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in this.  This should tell us roughly how many terms would need to be added in the Harmonic Series to surpass 100. Approximating <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> with a computer is not too bad.  We could make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> as large as we wish in <span class="process-math">\(\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\right)-\)</span>ln<span class="process-math">\(\left(1+n\right)\)</span> to make closer approximations for <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{.}\)</span>  The real issue is, <em class="alert">HOW DO WE KNOW THAT</em></p>
