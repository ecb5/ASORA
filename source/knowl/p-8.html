<p>The traditional approach to this topic (what we might call the “logical” story of Real Analysis), starts with a rigorous development of the real number system and uses this to provide rigorous definitions of limits, continuity, derivatives and integrals, and convergence of series; typically in that order. This is a perfectly legitimate story of Real Analysis and, logically, it makes the most sense. Indeed, this is a view of the subject that every mathematician-in-training should eventually attain. However, it is our contention that your students will appreciate the subject more, and hopefully retain it better, if they see how the subject developed from the intuitive notions of Leibniz, Newton and others in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to the more modern approach developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. After all, they are coming at it from a viewpoint very similar to that of the mathematicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Our goal is to bring them into the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, mathematically speaking.</p>
