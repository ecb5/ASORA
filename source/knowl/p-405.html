<p>Issues such as these and, more generally, the validity of using the infinitely small and infinitely large certainly existed in the 1700's, but they were overshadowed by the utility of the calculus. Indeed, foundational questions raised by the above examples, while certainly interesting and of importance, did not significantly deter the exploitation of calculus in studying physical phenomena. However, the envelope eventually was pushed to the point that not even the most practically oriented mathematician could avoid the foundational issues.</p>
