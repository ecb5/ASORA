<p>These cuts will henceforth be called the “positive numbers;”  .  .  .</p>
<p>We create a new number <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> (to be read “zero”), distinct from the positive numbers.</p>
<p>We also create numbers which are distinct from the positive numbers as well as distinct from zero, and which we will call negative numbers, in such a way that to each <span class="process-math">\(\xi\)</span> (I.e. to each positive number) we assign a negative number denoted by <span class="process-math">\(-\xi\)</span> (<span class="process-math">\(-\)</span> to be read “minus”). In this, <span class="process-math">\(-\xi\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-\nu\)</span> will be considered as the same number (as equal) if and only if <span class="process-math">\(\xi\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\nu\)</span> are the same number.</p>
<p>The totality consisting of all positive numbers, of <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> and of all negative numbers, will be called the real numbers.</p>
