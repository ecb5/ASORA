<p>A testing strategy we have used successfully is to assign more time consuming problems as collected homework and to assign other problems as possible test questions. Students could then be given some subset of these (verbatim) as an in-class test. Not only does this make test creation more straightforward, but it allows the opportunity to ask questions that could not reasonably be asked otherwise in a timed setting. Our experience is that this does not make the tests “too easy,” and there are worse things than having students study by working together on possible test questions beforehand. If you are shocked by the idea of giving students all of the possible test questions ahead of time, think of how much (re)learning you did studying the list of possible questions you <em class="emphasis">knew</em> would be asked on a qualifying exam.</p>
