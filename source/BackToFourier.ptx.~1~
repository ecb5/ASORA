  <title>Back to the Real Numbers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we have seen, when they converge,
      power series are very well behaved and Fourier (trigonometric) series are not necessarily.
      The fact that trigonometric series were so interesting made them a lightning rod for mathematical study in the late nineteenth century.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, consider the question of uniqueness.
      We saw in <xref ref="chapt_taylor-series">Chapter</xref>
      that if a function could be represented by a power series,
      then that series must be the Taylor series.
      More precisely, if
      <me>
        f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x-a)^n, \text{  then  }  a_n=\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what can be said about the uniqueness of a trigonometric series?
      If we can represent a function <m>f</m> as a general trigonometric series
      <me>
        f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x\,+b_n\sin n\pi x)
      </me>,
      then must this be the Fourier series with the coefficients as determined by Fourier?
          <idx><h>Fourier, Jean Baptiste Joseph</h></idx>
    </p>

    <p>
      For example,
      if <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x\,+b_n\sin n\pi x)</m> converges to <m>f</m> uniformly on the interval <m>(0,1)</m>,
      then because of the uniform convergence, Fourier's term-by-term integration which we saw in <xref ref="Interregnum">Part</xref>
      is perfectly legitimate and the coefficients are,
      of necessity, the coefficients he computed.
      However we have seen that the convergence of a Fourier series need not be uniform.
      This does not mean that we cannot integrate term-by-term,
      but it does say that we can't be sure that term-by-term integration of a Fourier series will yield the integral of the associated function.

          <idx><h>Lebesgue, Henri</h></idx> 
          <idx><h>Cantor, Georg</h></idx> 
          This led to a generalization of the integral by Henri
          Lebesgue in 1905.  Lebesgue's profound work settled the
          issue of whether or not a bounded pointwise converging
          trigonometric series is the Fourier series of a function,
          but we will not go in this direction.  We will instead focus
          on work that Georg Cantor did in the years just prior.
          Cantor's work was also profound and had far reaching
          implications in modern mathematics.  It also leads to some
          very weird conclusions.<fn> 'Weird' does not mean false.  It
          simply means that some of Cantor's results can be hard to
          accept, even after you have seen the proof and verified its
          validity.
      </fn> 
    </p>

    <p>
      To begin, let's suppress the underlying function and suppose we have
      <me>
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos n\pi x\,+b_n\sin n\pi x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty(a^\prime_n\cos n\pi x\,+b^\prime_n\sin n\pi x)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We ask: If these two series are equal must it be true that <m>a_n=a^\prime_n</m> and
      <m>b_n=b^\prime_n?</m> We can reformulate this uniqueness question as follows: Suppose
      <me>
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty\left((a_n-a^\prime_n)\cos n\pi x\,+(b_n-b^\prime_n)\sin n\pi x\right) = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we let <m>c_n = a_n-a^\prime_n</m> and <m>d_n = b_n=b^\prime_n</m>,
      then the question becomes: If <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(c_n\cos n\pi x\,+d_n\sin n\pi x\right) = 0</m>,
      then will <m>c_n=d_n=0?</m> It certainly seems reasonable to suppose so,
      but at this point we have enough experience with infinite sums to know that we need to be <em>very</em>
      careful about relying on the intuition we have honed on finite sums.

          <h>Cantor, Georg</h>
           <h>and the modern view of mathematics</h>
      </idx>
      The answer to this seemingly basic question leads to some very
      profound results.  In particular, answering this question led
      the mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918) to study the makeup
      of the real number system.  This in turn opened the door to the
      modern view of mathematics of the twentieth century.  In
      particular, Cantor proved the following result in 1871<nbsp
      />(<xref ref="jahnke03__histor_analy"/>, p. 305).

         If the trigonometric series

          then all of its coefficients vanish.

      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      In his attempts to nail down precisely which <q>certain values</q>
      could be exceptional, Cantor was led to examine the nature of subsets of real numbers and ultimately to give a precise definition of the concept of infinite sets and to define an arithmetic of
      <q>infinite numbers.</q> (Actually,
      he called them {transfinite numbers} because,
      by definition, numbers are finite.)
    </p>

    <p>
      As a first step toward identifying those
      <q>certain values,</q> Cantor 
      proved the following theorem,
      which we will state but not prove.

    <p>
      Observe that this is not a trivial generalization.
      Although the exceptional points are constrained to be finite in number,
      this number could still be extraordinarily large.
      That is, even if the series given above differed from zero on
      <m>10^{10^{100000}}</m> distinct points in the interval
      <m>(0, 10^{10^{-100000}})</m> the coefficients still vanish.
      This remains true even if at each of these
      <m>10^{10^{100000}}</m> points the series converges to <m>10^{10^{100000}}</m>.
      This is truly remarkable when you think of it this way.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point Cantor became more interested in these exceptional points than in the Fourier series problem that he'd started with.
      The next task he set for himself was to see just how general the set of exceptional points could be.
      Following Cantor's lead we make the following definitions.

          Let <m>S\subseteq \RR</m> and let <m>a</m> be a real number.
          We say that <m>a</m> is a <term>limit point</term>
          (or an <term>accumulation point</term>)
          of <m>S</m> if there is a sequence <m>(a_n)</m> with
          <m>a_n\in S-\left\{a\right\}</m> which converges to <m>a</m>.

              <idx><h>accumulation points</h></idx>
          Let <m>S\subseteq\RR</m> and let <m>a</m> be a real number.
          Prove that <m>a</m> is a limit point of <m>S</m> if and only if for every <m>\eps>0</m> the intersection
          <me>
            (a-\eps, a+\eps) \cap S-\left\{a\right\} \neq \emptyset.{}

    <p>
      The following definition gets to the heart of the matter.
