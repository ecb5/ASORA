  <title>Radius of Convergence of a Power Series</title>
  <p>
    We've developed enough machinery to look at the convergence of power series.
    The fundamental result is the following theorem due to Abel.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_RadiusOfConvergence">
    <statement>

            <idx><h>series</h><h>radius of convergence</h></idx>
            <idx><h>converge inside radius of convergence</h></idx>
        Suppose <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nc^n</m> converges for some nonzero real number <m>c</m>.
        Then <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> converges absolutely for all <m>x</m> such that <m>|x|\lt |c|</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    To prove <xref ref="thm_RadiusOfConvergence">Theorem</xref>
    first note that by <xref ref="prob_NthTermTest">Problem</xref>,
    <m>\limit{n}{\infty}{a_nc^n}=0</m>.
    Thus <m>\left(a_nc^n\right)</m> is a bounded sequence.
    Let <m>B</m> be a bound: <m>\abs{ac^n}\le B</m>.
    Then
    <me>
      \abs{a_nx^n}=\abs{a_nc^n\cdot\left(\frac{x}{c}\right)^n}\leq B\abs{\frac{x}{c}}^n
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can now use the comparison test.

  <p>
    As a result of <xref ref="thm_RadiusOfConvergence">Theorem</xref>
    and <xref ref="cor_RadiusOfDivergence">Corollary</xref>,
    we have the following:
    either <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> converges absolutely for all <m>x</m> or there exists some nonnegative real number <m>r</m> such that
    <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> converges absolutely when
    <m>|x|\lt r</m> and diverges when <m>|x|>r</m>.
    In the latter case, we call <m>r</m> the
    <em>radius of convergence</em>
    of the power series <m>\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n} x^{n}</m>.
    In the former case,
    we say that the radius of convergence of <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> is <m>\infty</m>.
    Though we can say that <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> converges absolutely when <m>|x|\lt r</m>,
    we cannot say that the convergence is uniform.
    However, we can come close.
    We can show that the convergence is uniform for <m>|x|\leq b\lt r</m>.
    To see this we will use the following result
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_WeierstrassM">
    <statement>

      <p>
        <idx><h>Weierstrass-<m>M</m> Test</h></idx> <idx><h>Weierstrass-<m>M</m> Test</h></idx> Let
        <m>\left(f_n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m> be a sequence of functions defined on <m>S\subseteq\RR</m> and suppose that
        <m>\left(M_n\right)_{n=1}^\infty</m> is a sequence of nonnegative real numbers such that
        <me>
          \abs{f_n(x)}\leq M_n,\,\, \forall x\in S,\,\, n=1, 2, 3, \ldots
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty M_n</m> converges then
        <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)</m> converges uniformly on <m>S</m> to some function (which we will denote by <m>f(x)</m>).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
<title>Sketch of Proof</title>
    <p>
      Since the crucial feature of the theorem is the function <m>f(x)</m> that our series converges to,
      our plan of attack is to first define <m>f(x)</m> and then show that our series,
      <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)</m>,
      converges to it uniformly.
    </p>

    <p>
      First observe that for any <m>x\in S</m>,
      <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)</m> converges by the Comparison Test
      (in fact it converges absolutely)
      to some number we will denote by <m>f(x)</m>.
      This actually defines the function <m>f(x)</m> for all <m>x\in S</m>.
      It follows that <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x)</m> converges pointwise to <m>f(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, let <m>\eps>0</m> be given.
      Notice that since <m>\sum_{n=1}^\infty M_n</m> converges,
      say to <m>M</m>,
      then there is a real number, <m>N</m>,
      such that if <m>n>N</m>, then
      <me>
        \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty M_k = \abs{\sum_{k=n+1}^\infty M_k} = \abs{M-\sum_{k=1}^n M_k}\lt \eps
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should be able to use this to show that if <m>n>N</m>, then
      <me>
        \abs{f(x) - \sum_{k=1}^n f_k(x)}\lt  \eps, \, \, \forall x\in S
      </me>.

    To finish the story on differentiating and integrating power series,
    all we need to do is show that the power series, its integrated series,
    and its differentiated series all have the same radius of convergence.
    You might not realize it,
    but we already know that the integrated series has a radius of convergence at least as big as the radius of convergence of the original series.
    Specifically,
    suppose <m>f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m>has a radius of convergence <m>r</m> and let <m>|x|\lt r</m>.
    We know that <m>\,\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n</m> converges uniformly on an interval containing <m>0</m>and <m>x</m>,
    and so by <xref ref="cor_UniformConvergenceDerivative">Corollary</xref>,
    <m>\int_{t=0}^xf(t)\d t=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{a_n}{n+1}x^{n+1}\right)</m>.
    In other words,
    the integrated series converges for any <m>x</m> with<m>\,|x|\lt r</m>.
    This says that the radius of convergence of the integated series must be at least <m>r</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To show that the radii of convergence are the same,
    all we need to show is that the radius of convergence of the differentiated series is at least as big as <m>r</m> as well.
    Indeed, since the differentiated series of the integrated series is the original,
    then this would say that the original series and the integrated series have the same radii of convergence.
    Putting the differentiated series into the role of the original series,
    the original series is now the integrated series and so these would have the same radii of convergence as well.
    With this in mind, we want to show that if <m>|x|\lt r</m>,
    then <m>\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nnx^{n-1}</m> converges.
    The strategy is to mimic what we did in <xref ref="thm_RadiusOfConvergence">Theorem</xref>,
    where we essentially compared our series with a converging geometric series.
    Only this time we need to start with the differentiated geometric series.
