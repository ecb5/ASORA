        Use the definition of continuity to prove that the constant function <m>g(x)=c</m> is continuous at any point <m>a</m>.

              Use the definition of continuity to prove that <m>\ln x</m> is continuous at <m>1</m>. 
              <hint>
                You may want to use the fact
                <m>\abs{\ln x}\lt \eps\,\Leftrightarrow-\eps\lt \ln x\lt \eps</m> to find a <m>\delta</m>.
              </hint>

            <p>
              Use part (a) to prove that <m>\ln x</m> is continuous at any positive real number <m>a</m>. 
              <hint>
                <m>\ln(x)=\ln(x/a)+\ln(a)</m>.
                This is a combination of functions which are continuous at <m>a</m>.
                Be sure to explain how you know that
                <m>\ln(x/a)</m> is continuous at <m>a</m>.

            <idx><h>continuity</h><h>formal definition of discontinuity</h></idx>
        Write a formal definition of the statement <m>f</m> is not continuous at <m>a</m>, and use it to prove that the function <m>f(x)= \begin{cases}x\amp \text{ if } x\neq 1\\ 0\amp \text{ if } x=1 \end{cases}</m> is not continuous at <m>a=1</m>.
