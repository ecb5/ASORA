        Is it possible to have two rational numbers,
        <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, such that <m>a^b</m> is irrational?
        If so, display an example of such <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
        If not, prove that it is not possible.

Decide if it is possible to have two irrational numbers,
        <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, such that <m>a^b</m> is rational.
        Prove it in either case.
