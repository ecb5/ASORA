<div class="para">The “prime notation” for the derivative was not used by Taylor, Maclaurin or their contemporaries. It was introduced by Joseph Louis Lagrange in his 1779 work <i class="foreign">Théorie des Fonctions Analytiques</i>. In that work, Lagrange sought to get rid of Leibniz’s infinitesimals and base calculus on the power series idea. His idea was that by representing every function as a power series, calculus could be done “algebraically” by manipulating power series and examining various aspects of the series representation instead of appealing to the “controversial” notion of infinitesimals. He implicitly assumed that every continuous function could be replaced with its power series representation.</div>
