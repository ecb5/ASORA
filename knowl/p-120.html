<div class="para"> The fact that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> is not rational is cute and interesting, but unless, like the Pythagoreans of ancient Greece, you have a strongly held religious conviction that all numbers are rational, it does not seem terribly important. On the other hand, the very existence of <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> raises some interesting questions. For example what can the symbol <span class="process-math">\(4^{\sqrt{2}}\)</span> possibly mean? If the exponent were a rational number, say <span class="process-math">\(m/n\text{,}\)</span> then clearly <span class="process-math">\(4^{m/n}=\sqrt[n]{4^m}\text{.}\)</span> But since <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\neq m/n\)</span> for <em class="emphasis">any</em> integers <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> how do we interpret <span class="process-math">\(4^{\sqrt{2}}?\)</span> Does it have any meaning at all? The more you think about this, the more puzzling the existence of irrational numbers becomes. Suppose for example we reconsider the construction of a line segment of length <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\text{.}\)</span> It is clear that the construction works and that we really can build such a line segment. It exists.</div>
