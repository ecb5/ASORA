<div class="para">This is all very clean and satisfying until we examine it just a bit closer. Then it becomes quite mysterious. Consider again the rational numbers <span class="process-math">\(a/b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c/d\text{.}\)</span> If we think of these as lengths we can ask, "Is there a third length, say <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\text{,}\)</span> such that we can divide <span class="process-math">\(a/b\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> pieces, each of length <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> <em class="emphasis">and also</em> divide <span class="process-math">\(c/d\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> pieces each of length <span class="process-math">\(\alpha?\)</span>" A few minutes thought should convince you that this is the same as the problem of finding a common denominator so <span class="process-math">\(\alpha=\frac{1}{bd}\)</span> will work nicely. (Confirm this yourself.)</div>
