In this case, the old calculus rule that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives does not apply for this infinite sum, though it did apply before. As if the continuity issue wasn’t bad enough before, this was even worse. Power series were routinely differentiated and integrated term-by-term. This was part of their appeal. They were treated like “infinite polynomials.” Either there is some power series lurking that refuses to behave nicely, or there is some property that power series have that not all Fourier series have.</div>
