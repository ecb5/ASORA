<article class="proof"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Sketch of the Proof of Theorem 9.2.1.</span></h3> <div class="para">We’ve seen how we can use <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_LimDefOfContinuity.html" title="Theorem 9.2.1">Theorem 9.2.1</a>, now we need to prove <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_LimDefOfContinuity.html" title="Theorem 9.2.1">Theorem 9.2.1</a>.  The forward direction is fairly straightforward.  So we assume that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and start with a sequence <span class="process-math">\(\left(x_n\right)\)</span> which converges to <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> What is left to show is that <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(x_n)=f(a)\text{.}\)</span>  If you write down the definitions of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> being continuous at <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}x_n=a\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(x_n)=f(a)\text{,}\)</span> you should be able to get from what you are assuming to what you want to conclude.</div> <div class="para">To prove the converse, it is convenient to prove its contrapositive.  That is, we want to prove that if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not continuous at <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> then we can construct a sequence <span class="process-math">\(\left(x_n\right)\)</span> that converges to <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(\left(f(x_n)\right)\)</span>does not converge to <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\text{.}\)</span> First we need to recognize what it means for <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to not be continuous at <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span>  This says that somewhere there exists an <span class="process-math">\(\eps&gt;0\text{,}\)</span> such that no choice of <span class="process-math">\(\delta&gt;0\)</span> will work for this.  That is, for any such <span class="process-math">\(\delta\text{,}\)</span> there will exist <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(|\,x-a|\lt \delta\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(|f(x)-f(a)|\geq\eps\text{.}\)</span> With this in mind, if <span class="process-math">\(\delta=1\text{,}\)</span> then there will exist an <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(|\,x_1-a|\lt 1\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(|f(x_1)-f(a)|\geq\eps\text{.}\)</span>  Similarly, if <span class="process-math">\(\delta=\frac{1}{2}\text{,}\)</span> then there will exist an <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(|\,x_2-a|\lt \frac{1}{2}\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(|\,f(x_2)-f(a)|\geq\eps\text{.}\)</span>  If we continue in this fashion, we will create a sequence <span class="process-math">\(\left(x_n\right)\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(|\,x_n-a|\lt \frac{1}{n}\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(|f(x_n)-f(a)|\geq\eps\text{.}\)</span>  This should do the trick.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="SequencesAndContinuity.html#proof-15" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
