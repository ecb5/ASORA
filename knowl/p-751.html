<div class="para">This definition also makes very precise what we mean when we say that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> should be “close to” <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is “close enough to” <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span>  For example, intuitively we know that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^2\)</span> should be continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span>  This means that we should be able to get <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> to within, say, <span class="process-math">\(\eps=.1\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> provided we make <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> close enough to <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span>  Specifically, we want <span class="process-math">\(3.9\lt x^2\lt 4.1\text{.}\)</span>  This happens exactly when <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{3.9}\lt x\lt \sqrt{4.1}\text{.}\)</span>  Using the fact that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{3.9}\lt 1.98\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2.02\lt \sqrt{4.1}\text{,}\)</span> then we can see that if we get <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to within <span class="process-math">\(\delta=.02\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{3.9}\lt 1.98\lt x\lt 2.02\lt
\sqrt{4.1}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> will be within .<span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\,4\text{.}\)</span>  This is very straightforward.  What makes this situation more difficult is that we must be able to do this for any <span class="process-math">\(\eps&gt;0\text{.}\)</span>
