<div class="para">Michel Rolle first stated the following theorem in 1691. Given this date and the nature of the theorem it would be reasonable to suppose that Rolle was one of the early developers of calculus but this is not so.  In fact, Rolle was disdainful of both Newton  and Leibniz’s versions of calculus, once deriding them as a collection of “ingenious fallacies.” It is a bit ironic that his theorem is so fundamental to the modern development of the calculus he ridiculed.</div>
