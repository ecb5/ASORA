<div class="para"> This led to a generalization of the integral by Henri Lebesgue in 1905.  Lebesgue’s profound work settled the issue of whether or not a bounded pointwise converging trigonometric series is the Fourier series of a function, but we will not go in this direction.  We will instead focus on work that Georg Cantor (1845-1918) did in the years just prior. Cantor’s work was also profound and had far reaching implications in modern mathematics.  It also leads to some very weird conclusions.</div>
