<div class="para">To be sure, limits were always lurking in the background. In his attempts to justify his calculations, Newton  used what he called his doctrine of “Ultimate Ratios.” Specifically the ratio <span class="process-math">\(\frac{(x+h)^2-x^2}{h} = \frac{2xh+h^2}{h} = 2x+h\)</span> becomes the ultimate ratio <span class="process-math">\(2x\)</span> at the last instant of time before <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> - an “evanescent quantity” - vanishes (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/grabiner81__origin_cauch_rigor_calculy.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 4">[4]</a>, p. 33). Similarly Leibniz’s “infinitely small” differentials <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ x}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ y}\)</span> can be seen as an attempt to get “arbitrarily close” to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> respectively. This is the idea at the heart of calculus: to get arbitrarily close to, say, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> without actually reaching it.</div>
