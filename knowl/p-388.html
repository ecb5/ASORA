<div class="para">This says that if we add enough terms of <span class="process-math">\(-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{6}-\cdots\)</span> we can make such a sum as small as we wish and if we add enough terms of <span class="process-math">\(1+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\cdots\)</span> we can make such a sum as large as we wish. This provides us with the general outline of the proof. The trick is to add just enough positive terms until the sum is just greater than <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> Then we start to add on negative terms until the sum is just less than <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> Picking up where we left off with the positive terms, we add on just enough positive terms until we are just above <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> again. We then add on negative terms until we are below <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> In essence, we are bouncing back and forth around <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> If we do this carefully, then we can get this rearrangement to converge to <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> The notation in the proof below gets a bit hairy, but keep this general idea in mind as you read through it.</div>
