<div class="para">The irony of this section is that it exists to tell you that this book was not written for you; it was written for your students. After all, we donâ€™t need to teach you about Real Analysis. You already understand the subject. The purpose of this text is to help your students make sense of the formal definitions, theorems, and proofs that they will encounter in your course. We do this by immersing the student in the story of how what is usually called Calculus evolved into modern Real Analysis. Our hope and intention is that this will help the student to appreciate why their intuitive understanding of topics encountered in calculus needs to be replaced by the formalism of Real Analysis.</div>
