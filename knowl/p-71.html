<div class="para">This text has been written with the maturation process in mind. You will frequently find that the problems you solve today can be used to good effect in the ones you attempt tomorrow, but only if you remember them. So take a moment after youâ€™ve solved each problem to think about how it fits into the patterns you already know. This is important enough to bear repeating: <em class="emphasis">A problem, once solved, becomes a tool for solving subsequent problems!</em>
