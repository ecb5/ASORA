<div class="para">Of course, there is the detail of showing that there is such a cut <span class="process-math">\(\delta\text{.}\)</span> (We warned you of the tediousness of all this.) Landau goes through the details of showing that such a cut exists. We will present an alternative by defining the cut <span class="process-math">\(\alpha-\beta\)</span> directly (assuming <span class="process-math">\(\beta\lt \alpha\)</span>). To motivate this definition, consider something we are familiar with: <span class="process-math">\(3-2=1\text{.}\)</span> In terms of cuts, we want to say that the open interval from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> “minus” the open interval from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> should give us the open interval from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> Taking elements from <span class="process-math">\((0,3)\)</span> and subtracting elements from <span class="process-math">\((0,2)\)</span> won’t do it as we would have differences such as <span class="process-math">\(2.9-.9=2\)</span> which is not in the cut <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\text{.}\)</span> A moment’s thought tells us that what we need to do is take all the elements from <span class="process-math">\((0,3)\)</span> and subtract all the elements from <span class="process-math">\((2,\infty)\text{,}\)</span> restricting ourselves only to those which are positive rational numbers. This prompts the following definition.</div>
