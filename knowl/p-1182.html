<div class="para">From <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Converge-_Cauchy.html" title="Theorem 11.2.11">TheoremÂ 11.2.11</a> we see that every Cauchy sequence converges in <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{.}\)</span> Moreover the proof of this fact depends on the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem which, as we have seen, is equivalent to our completeness axiom, the Nested Interval Property. What this means is that if there is a Cauchy sequence which does not converge then the NIP is not true. A natural question to ask is if every Cauchy sequence converges does the NIP follow? That is, is the convergence of Cauchy sequences also equivalent to our completeness axiom? The following theorem shows that the answer is yes.</div>
