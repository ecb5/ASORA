<div class="para">Another place where Cantorâ€™s work had a profound influence in modern logic comes from something we alluded to before.  We showed before that the unit square <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\times [0,1]\)</span> had the same cardinality as an uncountable subset of <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{.}\)</span>  In fact, Cantor  showed that the unit square had the same cardinality as <span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span> itself and was moved to advance the following in 1878.</div>
