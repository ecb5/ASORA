<div class="para">To see this consider the sequence <span class="process-math">\(\left(1,\frac12,\frac13,\frac14,\ldots\right)\text{.}\)</span> Clearly it “approaches” zero, right? But, doesn’t it also “approach” <span class="process-math">\(-1?\)</span> It does, in the sense that each term gets closer to <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> than the one previous. But it also “approaches” <span class="process-math">\(-2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(-3\text{,}\)</span> or even <span class="process-math">\(-1000\)</span> in the same sense. That’s the problem with the word “approaches.” It just says that we’re getting closer to something than we were in the previous step. It does <em class="emphasis">not</em> tell us that we are actually getting close. Since the moon moves in an elliptical orbit about the earth for part of each month it is “approaching” the earth. The moon gets clos<em class="emphasis">er</em> to the earth but, thankfully, it does not get <em class="emphasis">close</em> to the earth. The implicit assumption we alluded to earlier is this: When we say that the sequence <span class="process-math">\(\left(\frac1n\right)_{n=1}^\infty\)</span> “approaches” zero we mean that it is getting <em class="emphasis">close</em> not clos<em class="emphasis">er</em>. Ordinarily this kind of vagueness in our language is pretty innocuous. When we say “approaches” in casual conversation we can usually tell from the context of the conversation whether we mean “getting close to” or “getting closer to.” But when speaking mathematically we need to be more careful, more explicit, in the language we use.</div>
