<div class="para">Notice that we used the NIP to prove both the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem and the LUBP. This is really unavoidable, as it turns out that all of those statements are equivalent in the sense that any one of them can be taken as the completeness axiom for the real number system and the others proved as theorems. This is not uncommon in mathematics, as people tend to gravitate toward ideas that suit the particular problem they are working on. In this case, people realized at some point that they needed some sort of completeness property for the real number system to prove various theorems. Each individualâ€™s formulation of completeness fit in with his understanding of the problem at hand. Only in hindsight do we see that they were really talking about the same concept: the completeness of the real number system. In point of fact, most modern textbooks use the LUBP as the axiom of completeness and prove all other formulations as theorems. We will finish this section by showing that either the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem or the LUBP can be used to prove the NIP. This says that they are all equivalent and that any one of them could be taken as the completeness axiom.</div>
