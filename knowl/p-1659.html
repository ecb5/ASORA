<div class="para">Properties I-III really say that Dedekind cuts are bounded open intervals of rational numbers starting at <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> For example, <span class="process-math">\((0,3)\cap\QQ^+\)</span> is a Dedekind cut (which will eventually be the real number <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>). Likewise, <span class="process-math">\(\left\{x|x^2\lt 2\right\}\cap\QQ^+\)</span> is a Dedekind cut (which will eventually be the real number <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>). Notice that care must be taken not to actually refer to irrational numbers in the properties as the purpose is to construct them from rational numbers, but it might help to ground you to anticipate what will happen.</div>
