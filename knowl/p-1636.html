<div class="para">The method of “Dedekind cuts” first developed by Richard Dedekind  (though he just called them “cuts”) in his 1872 book, <em class="emphasis">Continuity and the Irrational Numbers</em> shares the advantage of the Cauchy sequence method in that, once the candidates for the real numbers have been identified, it is very clear how addition and multiplication should be defined. It is also straightforward to show that most of the field axioms are satisfied.</div>
