<div class="para">But this is the point! We left those computations out precisely because we knew that they were routine and that you could fill in the details. Moreover, filling in the details yourself gives you a little better insight into the computations. If we’d filled them in for you we would have robbed you of that insight. And we would have made this book longer than it needs to be. We don’t want to do either of those things. If we fill in all of the details of every computation for you, you won’t learn to have confidence in your ability to do them yourself. And this book will easily double in length.</div>
