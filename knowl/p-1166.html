<div class="para">Knowing that a sequence or a series converges and knowing what it converges to are typically two different matters. For example, we know that <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!}\)</span>and <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!\,n!}\)</span> both converge. The first converges to <span class="process-math">\(e,\)</span> which has meaning in other contexts. We donâ€™t know what the second one converges to, other than to say it converges to <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!\,n!}\text{.}\)</span> In fact, that question might not have much meaning without some other context in which <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!\,n!}\)</span> arises naturally. Be that as it may, we need to look at the convergence of a series (or a sequence for that matter) without necessarily knowing what it might converge to. We make the following definition.</div>
