<div class="para">Since these days the limit concept is generally regarded as the starting point for calculus, you might think it is a little strange that weâ€™ve chosen to talk about continuity first. But historically, the formal definition of a limit came after the formal definition of continuity. In some ways, the limit concept was part of a unification of all the ideas of calculus that were studied previously and, subsequently, it became the basis for all ideas in calculus. For this reason it is logical to make it the first topic covered in a calculus course.</div>
