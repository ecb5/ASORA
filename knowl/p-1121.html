<div class="para">We have developed precise analytic definitions of the convergence of a sequence and continuity of a function and we have used these to prove the EVT and IVT for a continuous function. We will now draw our attention back to the question that originally motivated these definitions, “Why are Taylor series well behaved, but Fourier series are not necessarily?” More precisely, we mentioned that whenever a power series converges then whatever it converged to was continuous. Moreover, if we differentiate or integrate these series term by term then the resulting series will converge to the derivative or integral of the original series. This was not always the case for Fourier series. For example consider the function</div>

f(x) \amp = \frac{4}{\pi}\left(\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\cos\left((2k+1)\pi x\right)\right)\\
\amp = \frac{4}{\pi}\left(\cos(\pi x)-\frac13\cos(3\pi x)+\frac15 (5\pi x)-\ldots\right)\text{.}
