<div class="para">Consider, first we add <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> This is one of the positive terms so our sum is starting to increase without bound. Next we add <span class="process-math">\(-1/2\)</span> which is one of the negative terms so our sum has turned around and is now starting to decrease without bound. Then another positive term is added: increasing without bound. Then another negative term: decreasing. And so on. The convergence of the alternating Harmonic Series is the result of a delicate balance between a tendency to run off to positive infinity and back to negative infinity. When viewed in this light it is not really too surprising that rearranging the terms can destroy this delicate balance.</div>
