<div class="para">Newton’s approach to calculus — his ‘Method of Fluxions’ — depended fundamentally on motion. That is, he viewed his variables (fluents) as changing (flowing or fluxing) in time.  The rate of change of a fluent he called a fluxion.  As a foundation both Leibniz’s and Newton’s approaches have fallen out of favor, although both are still universally used as a conceptual approach, a “way of thinking,” about the ideas of calculus.</div>
