<div class="para">Before the invention of calculus, the notion of continuity was treated intuitively if it was treated at all.  At first pass, it seems a very simple idea based solidly in our experience of the real world.  Standing on the bank we see a river flow past us continuously, not by tiny jerks.  Even when the flow might seem at first to be discontinuous, as when it drops precipitously over a cliff, a closer examination shows that it really is not. As the water approaches the cliff it speeds up.  When it finally goes over it accelerates very quickly but no matter how fast it goes it moves continuously, moving from here to there by occupying every point in between.  This is continuous motion. It never disappears over there and instantaneously reappears over here.  That would be discontinuous motion.</div>
