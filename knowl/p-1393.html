<div class="para">Cantor was able to overcome this technicality to demonstrate a one to one correspondence, but instead we will note that in either convention, the function is one-to-one, so this says that the set <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\times[0,1]\)</span> is the same cardinality as some (uncountable) subset of <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{.}\)</span>  The fact that this has the same cardinality as <span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span> is something we will come back to. But first weâ€™ll try construct an uncountable set which does not have the same cardinality as <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{.}\)</span>  To address this issue, Cantor proved the following in 1891.</div>
