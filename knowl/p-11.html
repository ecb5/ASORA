<div class="para">Thus the proofs of nearly all of the theorems appear as problems in the text. Of course, it would be very unfair to ask most students at this level to prove, say, the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem without some sort of guidance. So in each case we provide an outline of the proof and the subsequent problem will be to use the outline to develop a formal proof. Proof outlines will become less detailed as the students progress. We have found that this approach helps students develop their proof writing skills.</div>
