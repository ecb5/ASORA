Actually, both of these lines have holes in them.  Wherever there is a point on one line there is a “hole” on the other.  Each of these holes is the width of a single point (that is, their “width” is zero!) so they are invisible to the naked eye (or even magnified under the most powerful microscope available).  This idea is illustrated in the following graph</div>
