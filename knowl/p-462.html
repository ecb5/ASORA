<div class="para">One way would be to say that we can make <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> as close to zero as we wish, provided we make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> large enough. But even this needs to be made more specific. For example, we can get <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> to within a distance of <span class="process-math">\(.1\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> provided we make <span class="process-math">\(n&gt;10\text{,}\)</span> we can get <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> to within a distance of <span class="process-math">\(.01\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> provided we make <span class="process-math">\(n&gt;100\text{,}\)</span> etc. After a few such examples it is apparent that given any arbitrary distance <span class="process-math">\(\eps&gt;0\text{,}\)</span> we can get <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> to within <span class="process-math">\(\eps\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> provided we make <span class="process-math">\(n&gt;\frac{1}{\eps}\text{.}\)</span> This leads to the following definition.</div>
