<div class="para">We will often informally state this theorem as “the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.” However, to be absolutely precise, what it says is that if we already know that two sequences converge, then the sequence formed by summing the corresponding terms of those two sequences will converge and, in fact, converge to the sum of those individual limits. We’ll provide the scrapwork for the proof of this and leave the formal write-up as an exercise. Note the use of the triangle inequality in the proof.</div>
