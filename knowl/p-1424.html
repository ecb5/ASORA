<div class="para">So by trying to put the foundations of calculus on solid ground, we have come to a point where we can never obtain mathematical certainty. Does this mean that we should throw up our hands and concede defeat? Should we be paralyzed with fear of trying anything? Certainly not! As we mentioned before, most mathematicians do well by taking a pragmatic approach: using their mathematics to solve problems that they encounter. In fact, it is typically the problems that motivate the mathematics. It is true that mathematicians take chances that donâ€™t always pan out, but they still take these chances, often with success. Even when the successes lead to more questions, as they typically do, tackling those questions usually leads to a deeper understanding. At the very least, our incomplete understanding means we will always have more questions to answer, more problems to solve.</div>
