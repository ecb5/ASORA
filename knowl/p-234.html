<div class="para">We are missing something important here, though it may not be clear exactly what. A series representation of a function works <em class="emphasis">sometimes,</em> but there are some problems. For now, we will continue to follow the example of our 18th century predecessors and ignore them. That is, for the rest of this section we will focus on the formal manipulations to obtain and use power series representations of various functions. Keep in mind that this is all highly suspect until we can resolve problems like those just given.</div>
