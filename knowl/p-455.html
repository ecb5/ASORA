<div class="para">In <a href="CalcIn17th18thCentury.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: Calculus in the 17th and 18th Centuries">ChapterÂ 4</a>, we developed the equation <span class="process-math">\(1+x+x^2+x^3+\cdots=\frac{1}{1-x}\text{,}\)</span> and we mentioned there were limitations to this power series representation.  For example, substituting <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> into this expression leads to</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/CalcIn17th18thCentury.html">
\begin{equation*}
1+1+1+\cdots=\frac{1}{0} \text{ and }  1-1+1-1+\cdots=\frac{1}{2}\
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">which are rather hard to accept.  On the other hand, if we substitute <span class="process-math">\(x=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> into the expression we get <span class="process-math">\(1+\frac{1}{2}+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3+\cdots=2\)</span> which seems more palatable until we think about it.  We can add two numbers together by the method we all learned in elementary school.  Or three.  Or any finite set of numbers, at least in principle.  But infinitely many?  What does that even mean? Before we can add infinitely many numbers together we must find a way to give meaning to the idea.</div>
