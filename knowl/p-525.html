<div class="para">As youâ€™ve seen from the previous sections, the formal definition of the convergence of a sequence is meant to capture rigorously our intuitive understanding of convergence. However, the definition itself is an unwieldy tool. If only there was a way to be rigorous without having to run back to the definition each time. Fortunately, there is a way. If we can use the definition to prove some general rules about limits then we could use these rules whenever they applied and be assured that everything was still rigorous. A number of these should look familiar from calculus.</div>
