<div class="para"> For example, what about the line segment represented by the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span> and the square represented by the set <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\times[0,1]=\left\{(x,y)|0\leq x,y\leq 1\right\}\text{.}\)</span> Certainly the two dimensional square must be a larger infinite set than the one dimensional line segment.  Remarkably, Cantor showed that these two sets were the same cardinality.  In his 1877 correspondence of this result to his friend and fellow mathematician, Richard Dedekind, even Cantor remarked, “I see it, but I don’t believe it!”</div>
