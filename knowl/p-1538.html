At first you are lost.  The layout of the room and furniture are unknown so you fumble about for a bit and slowly get a sense of your immediate environs, perhaps a vague notion of the organization of the room as a whole.  Eventually, after much, often tedious exploration, you become quite comfortable in your room.  But always there will be dark corners; hidden areas you have not yet explored.  Such a dark area may hide anything; the latches to unopened doors you didn’t know were there; a clamp whose presence explains why you couldn’t move that little desk in the corner; even the light switch that would allow you to illuminate an area more clearly than you would have imagined possible.</div>
