<div class="para">When foundational issues came to the forefront, infinitesimals fell somewhat out of favor. You probably didnâ€™t use them very much in calculus. Most of the time you probably used the prime notation, <span class="process-math">\(f^\prime(x)\)</span> introduced by Lagrange  in the eighteenth century. Some of the themes in this book are: Why differentials fell out of favor, what were they replaced with and how the modern notations you learned in calculus evolved over time.</div>
