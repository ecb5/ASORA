<div class="para">It will be instructive to take a look at an argument that doesn’t quite work before looking at the formal definitions we will need. In 1821 Augustin Cauchy “proved” that the infinite sum of continuous functions is continuous. Of course, it is obvious (to us) that this is not true because we’ve seen several counterexamples. But Cauchy, who was a first rate mathematician was so sure of the correctness of his argument that he included it in his textbook on analysis, <i class="foreign">Cours d’analyse</i> (1821).</div>
