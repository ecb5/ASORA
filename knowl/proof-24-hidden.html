<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Suppose we have our sequence <span class="process-math">\(\left(x_n\right)\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a,b]\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\forall\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> To find our <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> for the subsequence to converge to we will use the NIP. Since we are already using <span class="process-math">\(\left(x_n\right)\)</span> as our original sequence, we will need to use different letters in setting ourselves up for the NIP. With this in mind, let <span class="process-math">\(a_1=a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b_1=b\text{,}\)</span> and notice that <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a_1,b_1]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> (This is, in fact true for all <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> but you'll see why we said it the way we did.) Let <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> be the midpoint of <span class="process-math">\([a_1,b_1]\)</span> and notice that either <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a_1,m_1]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[m_1,b_1]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a_1,m_1]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> then we relabel <span class="process-math">\(a_2=a_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b_2=m_1\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[m_1,b_1]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> then relabel <span class="process-math">\(a_2=m_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b_2=b_1\text{.}\)</span> In either case, we get <span class="process-math">\(a_1\leq a_2\leq b_2\leq b_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b_2-a_2=\frac{1}{2}\left(b_1-a_1\right)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a_2,b_2]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Now we consider the interval <span class="process-math">\([a_2,b_2]\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> be the midpoint of <span class="process-math">\([a_2,b_2]\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a_2,b_2]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> then either <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a_2,m_2]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[m_2,b_2]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a_2,m_2]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> then we relabel <span class="process-math">\(a_3=a_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b_3=m_2\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[m_2,b_2]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> then we relabel <span class="process-math">\(a_3=m_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b_3=b_2\text{.}\)</span> In either case, we get <span class="process-math">\(a_1\leq a_2\leq a_3\leq b_3\leq b_2\leq b_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b_3-a_3=\frac{1}{2}\left(b_2-a_2\right)=\frac{1}{2^2}\left(b_1-a_1\right)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a_3,b_3]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>If we continue in this manner, we will produce two sequences <span class="process-math">\(\left(a_k\right)\)</span>and <span class="process-math">\(\left(b_k\right)\)</span> with the following properties:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle a_1\leq a_2\leq a_3\leq\cdots\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle b_1\geq b_2\geq b_3\geq\cdots\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\forall\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(k,\,a_k\leq b_k\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \displaystyle\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}\left(b_k-a_k\right)=\,\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{2^{k-1}}\left(b_1-a_1\right)=0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>For each <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[\,a_k,b_k]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>By properties 1-5 and the NIP, there exists a unique <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(c\in[a_k,b_k]\text{,}\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> In particular, <span class="process-math">\(c\in[a_1,b_1]=[a,b]\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We have our <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> Now we need to construct a subsequence converging to it. Since <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a_1,b_1]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> choose an integer <span class="process-math">\(n_1\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x_{n_1}\in[a_1,b_1]\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a_2,b_2]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> choose an integer <span class="process-math">\(n_2&gt;n_1\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x_{n_2}\in[a_2,b_2]\text{.}\)</span> (Notice that to make a subsequence it is crucial that <span class="process-math">\(n_2&gt;n_1\text{,}\)</span> and this is why we needed to insist that <span class="process-math">\(x_n\in[a_2,b_2]\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>) Continuing in this manner, we should be able to build a subsequence <span class="process-math">\(\left(x_{n_k}\right)\)</span> that will converge to <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> You can supply the details in the following problem.</p></article></body>
