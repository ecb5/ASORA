<div class="para">The goal of starting with what is clear and simple and proceeding logically, rigorously, to what is complex is still a guiding principle of all mathematics for a variety of reasons. In the late nineteenth century, this principle was brought to bear on the real numbers. That is, some properties of the real numbers that at first seem simple and intuitively clear turn out on closer examination, as we have seen, to be rather counter-intuitive. This alone is not really a problem. We can have counter-intuitive properties in our mathematics — indeed, this is a big part of what makes mathematics interesting — as long as we arrive at them logically, starting from simple assumptions the same way Euclid did.</div>
