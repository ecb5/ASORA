<div class="para">Our next theorem says that in a certain, very technical sense there are more real numbers than there are counting numbers <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/franks10__cantor_other_proof_rr_uncoun.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3">[3]</a>. This probably does not seem terribly significant.  After all, there are real numbers which are not counting numbers.  What will make this so startling is that the same cannot be said about all sets which strictly contain the counting numbers.  We will get into the details of this after the theorem is proved.</div>
