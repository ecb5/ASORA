<div class="para">This is what happened in the late nineteenth century.  The real numbers had been used since the Pythagoreans learned that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> was irrational.  But really, most calculuations were (and still are) done with just the rational numbers. Moreover, since <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> forms a “set of measure zero,”  it is clear that most of the real numbers had gone completely unused. The set of real numbers was thus one of those “dark corners” of mathematics. It had to be explored.</div>
