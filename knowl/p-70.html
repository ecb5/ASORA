<div class="para">Take a moment to pack all of these questions (and their answers) away in your mind so that when you see something similar in the future you will be reminded of it. <em class="emphasis">Don’t</em> solve any problem and then forget it and move on. The nature of mathematics is cumulative. Remember, you are not here to accumulate grade points. You are here to learn and understand the concepts and methods of mathematics, to gain “mathematical maturity.” Part of that maturation process is the accumulation of a body of facts (theorems), and techniques that can be used to prove new theorems (solve new problems).</div>
