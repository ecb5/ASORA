<div class="para">Recall that in deriving the Lagrange and Cauchy forms of the remainder for Taylor series, we made use of the Extreme Value Theorem (<dfn class="terminology">EVT</dfn>) and Intermediate Value Theorem (<dfn class="terminology">IVT</dfn>). In <a href="Continuity.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 9: Continuity: What It Isn’t and What It Is">Chapter 9</a>, we produced an analytic definition of continuity that we can use to prove these theorems. To provide the rest of the necessary tools we need to explore the make-up of the real number system. To illustrate what we mean, suppose that we only used the rational number system. We could still use our definition of continuity and could still consider continuous functions such as <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^2\text{.}\)</span> Notice that <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> is a value that lies between <span class="process-math">\(f(1)=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(2)=4\text{.}\)</span>
