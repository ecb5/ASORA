<div class="para">The difference between these two definitions is subtle. In pointwise convergence, we are given a fixed <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\)</span> and an <span class="process-math">\(\eps&gt;0\text{.}\)</span> Then the task is to find an <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> that works for that particular <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\eps\text{.}\)</span> In uniform convergence, one is given <span class="process-math">\(\eps&gt;0\)</span> and must find a single <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> that works for that particular <span class="process-math">\(\eps\)</span> but also simultaneously (uniformly) for all <span class="process-math">\(x\in S\text{.}\)</span> Clearly uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence as an <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> which works uniformly for all <span class="process-math">\(x,\)</span> works for each individual <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> also. However the reverse is not true. This will become evident, but first consider the following example.</div>
