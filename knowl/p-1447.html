<em class="alert">Sagredo</em>: Ah! I see your point! That there are three elements does <em class="emphasis">not</em> depend on what those elements are. Any set with three elements has three elements regardless of the nature of the elements. Thus saying that the set <span class="process-math">\(\left\{1, 2, 3\right\}\)</span> contains three elements does not define the word “number” in a circular manner because it is irrelevant that the <em class="emphasis">number</em> 3 is one of the elements of the set. Thus to say that three is the cardinality of the set <span class="process-math">\(\left\{1, 2, 3\right\}\)</span> has the same meaning as saying that there are three elements in the set <span class="process-math">\(\left\{Salviati, Sagredo, Simplicio\right\}\text{.}\)</span> In both cases the number “<span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>” is the name that we give to the totality of the elements of each set.</div>
