<div class="para">Notice how fraction notation reflects the operation of comparing 1 to 2.  This comparison is usually referred to as the <em class="emphasis">ratio</em> of <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> so numbers of this sort are called <em class="emphasis">rational numbers.</em> The set of rational numbers is denoted <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> for quotients.  In grade school they were introduced to you as fractions.  Once fractions are understood, this visualization using line segments (sticks) leads quite naturally to their representation with the rational number line.</div>
