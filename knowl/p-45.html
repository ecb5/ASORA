<div class="para">Ferrari also knew how to compute the general solution of the “depressed quartic” so when he and his teacher Girolomo Cardano (1501-1576) figured out how to depress a general quartic they had a complete solution of the general quartic as well. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 28%; margin-left: 36%; margin-right: 36%;"><img src="external/images/Cardan.png" class="contained"></div>

Unfortunately the rest of this story belongs in a course on Abstract Algebra, not Real Analysis.  But the lesson in this story applies to all of mathematics: Every problem solved is a new theorem which then becomes a tool for later use.  Depressing a cubic would have been utterly useless had not Tartaglia had a solution of the depressed cubic in hand.  The technique they used, with slight modifications, then allowed for a solution of the general quartic as well.</div>
