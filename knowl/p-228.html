<div class="para">Before we continue, we will make the following notational comment. The most advantageous way to represent a series is using summation notation since there can be no doubt about the pattern to the terms. After all, this notation contains a formula for the general term. This being said, there are instances where writing this formula is not practical. In these cases, it is acceptable to write the sum by supplying the first few terms and using ellipses (the three dots). If this is done, then enough terms must be included to make the pattern clear to the reader.</div>
