<div class="para">We saw in the previous section that if <span class="process-math">\(\left(f_n\right)\)</span> is a sequence of continuous functions which converges uniformly to <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> on an interval, then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> must be continuous on the interval as well. This was not necessarily true if the convergence was only pointwise, as we saw a sequence of continuous functions defined on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,\infty)\)</span> converging pointwise to a Fourier series that was not continuous on the real line. Uniform convergence guarantees some other nice properties as well.</div>
