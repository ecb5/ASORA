<div class="para">The idea is that a subsequence of a sequence is a part of the sequence, <span class="process-math">\((x_n)\text{,}\)</span> which is itself a sequence. However, it is a little more restrictive. We can choose any term in our sequence to be part of the subsequence, but once we choose that term, we canâ€™t go backwards. This is where the condition <span class="process-math">\(n_1\lt n_2\lt n_3\lt \cdots\)</span> comes in. For example, suppose we started our subsequence with the term <span class="process-math">\(x_{100}\text{.}\)</span> We could not choose our next term to be <span class="process-math">\(x_{99}\text{.}\)</span> The subscript of the next term would have to be greater than 100. In fact, the thing about a subsequence is that it is all in the subscripts; we are really choosing a subsequence <span class="process-math">\(\left(n_k\right)\)</span> of the sequence of subscripts <span class="process-math">\(\left(n\right)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\left(x_n\right)\text{.}\)</span>
