<div class="para">For both continuity and the limit of a function we write things like <span class="process-math">\(\limit{x}{a}{f(x)}\)</span> and think of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as a variable that gets arbitrarily close to the number <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span>  Again, to be more mathematical in our language we would say that the limit parameter <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is taken from the <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\)</span> Well, actually, this is interesting isn’t it?  Do we need to take <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> or from <span class="process-math">\(\RR?\)</span> The requirement in both cases is simply that we be able to choose <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> arbitrarily close to <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> From <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_IrrationalBetweenIrrationals.html" title="Theorem 3.0.11">Theorem 3.0.11</a> of <a href="NumbersRealRational.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Numbers, Real (\RR) and Rational (\QQ)">Chapter 3</a> we see that this is possible whether <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is rational or not, so it seems either will work.  This leads to the pardoxical sounding conclusion that we do not need a continuum (<span class="process-math">\(\RR\)</span>) to have continuity.  This seems strange.</div>
