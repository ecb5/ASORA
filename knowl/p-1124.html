<div class="para">The difficulty is quite delicate and it took mathematicians a while to determine the problem.  There are two very subtly different ways that a sequence of functions can converge: pointwise or uniformly.  This distinction was touched upon by Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) in 1826 while studying the domain of convergence of a power series.  However, the necessary formal definitions were not made explicit until Weierstrass did it in his 1841 paper <span class="booktitle">Zur Theorie der Potenzreihen (On the Theory of Power Series)</span>. This was published in his collected works in 1894.</div>
