<div class="para">What makes <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> continuous at <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is the arbitrary nature of <span class="process-math">\(\eps\)</span> (as long as it is positive).  As <span class="process-math">\(\eps\)</span> becomes smaller, this forces <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> to be closer to <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\text{.}\)</span>  That we can always find a positive distance <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> to work is what we mean when we say that we can make <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as close to <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> as we wish, provided we get <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> close enough to <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span>  The sequence of pictures below illustrates that the phrase “for any <span class="process-math">\(\eps&gt;0\text{,}\)</span> there exists a <span class="process-math">\(\delta&gt;0\)</span> such that if <span class="process-math">\(|\,x-a|\lt \delta\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(|f(x)-f(a)|\lt \eps\)</span>” can be replaced by the equivalent formulation “for any <span class="process-math">\(\eps&gt;0\text{,}\)</span> there exists a <span class="process-math">\(\delta&gt;0\)</span> such that if <span class="process-math">\(a-\delta\lt x\lt a+\delta\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f(a)-\eps\lt f(x)\lt
f(a)+\eps\text{.}\)</span>” This could also be replaced by the phrase “for any <span class="process-math">\(\eps&gt;0\text{,}\)</span> there exists a <span class="process-math">\(\delta&gt;0\)</span> such that if <span class="process-math">\(x\in(a-\delta,a+\delta)\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\in(f(a)-\eps,f(a)+\eps)\text{.}\)</span>” All of these equivalent formulations convey the idea that we can get <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> to within <span class="process-math">\(\eps\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\text{,}\)</span> provided we make <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> within <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> and we will use whichever formulation suits our needs in a particular application.</div>
