<div class="para">Until the nineteenth century the geometry of Euclid, as given in his book <em class="emphasis">The Elements,</em> was universally regarded as the touchstone of mathematical perfection. This belief was so deeply embedded in Western culture that as recently as 1923, Edna St. Vincent Millay opened one of the poems in her book <em class="emphasis">The Harp Weaver and Other Poems</em> with the line “Euclid alone has looked on beauty bare.”</div>
