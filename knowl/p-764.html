<div class="para">Notice that in these proofs, the challenge of an <span class="process-math">\(\eps&gt;0\)</span> was first given.  This is because the choice of <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> must depend upon <span class="process-math">\(\eps\text{.}\)</span>  Also notice that there was no explanation for our choice of <span class="process-math">\(\delta\text{.}\)</span>  We just supplied it and showed that it worked.  As long as <span class="process-math">\(\delta&gt;0\text{,}\)</span> then this is all that is required.  In point of fact, the <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> we chose in each example was not the only choice that worked; any smaller <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> would work as well.</div>
