<div class="para">To finish the story on differentiating and integrating power series, all we need to do is show that the power series, its integrated series, and its differentiated series all have the same radius of convergence. You might not realize it, but we already know that the integrated series has a radius of convergence at least as big as the radius of convergence of the original series. Specifically, suppose <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n\)</span>has a radius of convergence <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(|x|\lt r\text{.}\)</span> We know that <span class="process-math">\(\,\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n\)</span> converges uniformly on an interval containing <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>and <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and so by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cor_IntConvUni.html" title="Corollary 11.2.4">CorollaryÂ 11.2.4</a>, <span class="process-math">\(\int_{t=0}^xf(t)\dx{ t}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{a_n}{n+1}x^{n+1}\right)\text{.}\)</span> In other words, the integrated series converges for any <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> with<span class="process-math">\(\,|x|\lt r\text{.}\)</span> This says that the radius of convergence of the integated series must be at least <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span>
