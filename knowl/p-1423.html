<div class="para">We are willing to bet that at this point your head might be swimming a bit with uncertainty. If so, then know that these are the same feelings that the mathematical community experienced in the mid twentieth century. In the past, mathematics was seen as a model of logical certainty. It is disconcerting to find that there are statements that are “undecidable.” In fact, Gödel proved in 1931 that a consistent finite axiom system that contained the axioms of arithmetic would always contain undecidable statements which could neither be proved true nor false with those axioms. Mathematical knowledge would always be incomplete.</div>
