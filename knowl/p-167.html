<div class="para">Leibniz called both <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ x}\)</span> “differentials” (Latin for difference) because he thought of them as, essentially, the same thing.  Over time it has become customary to refer to the infinitesimal <span class="process-math">\(\dx{ x}\)</span> as a differential, reserving “difference” for the finite case, <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\text{.}\)</span>  This is why calculus is often called “differential calculus.”</div>
