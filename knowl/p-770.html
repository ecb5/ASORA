<div class="para">Sometimes the <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> that will work for a particular <span class="process-math">\(\eps\)</span> is fairly obvious to see, especially after youâ€™ve gained some experience.  This is the case in the above examples (at least after looking back at the proofs).  However, the task of finding a <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> to work is usually not so obvious and requires some scrapwork.  This scrapwork is vital toward producing a <span class="process-math">\(\delta\text{,}\)</span> but again is not part of the polished proof.  This can be seen in the following example.</div>
