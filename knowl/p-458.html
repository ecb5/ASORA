<div class="para">Since each partial sum is located at the midpoint between the previous partial sum and <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> it is reasonable to suppose that these sums tend to the number 2. Indeed, you probably have seen an expression such as <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\left(\sum_{j=0}^n\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^j\right)=2\)</span> justified by a similar argument. Of course, the reliance on such pictures and words is fine if we are satisfied with intuition. However, we must be able to make these intuitions rigorous without relying on pictures or nebulous words such as “approaches.”</div>
