<div class="para">Take particular notice of the following three facts:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Very little mathematical knowledge is required to understand this definition. We need to know what a set is, we need to know what a rational number is, and we need to know that given two positive rational numbers either they are equal or one is greater.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The language Landau uses is <em class="emphasis">very</em> precise. This is necessary in order to avoid such nonsense as trying to compare something with nothing like we did a couple of paragraphs up.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We are only using the <em class="emphasis">positive</em> rational numbers for our construction. The reason for this will become clear shortly. As a practical matter for now, this means that the cuts we have just defined will (eventually) correspond to the <em class="emphasis">positive</em> real numbers.</div></li>
