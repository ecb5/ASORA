<div class="para">The idea of representing a function as a series of sine waves was proposed by Daniel Bernoulli in 1753 while examining the problem of modeling a vibrating string. Unfortunately for Bernoulli, he didnâ€™t know how to compute the coefficients in such a series representation. What distinguished Fourier was that he developed a technique to compute these coefficients. The key is the result of the following problem.</div>
