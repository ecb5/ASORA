<div class="para">To show that the radii of convergence are the same, all we need to show is that the radius of convergence of the differentiated series is at least as big as <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> as well. Indeed, since the differentiated series of the integrated series is the original, then this would say that the original series and the integrated series have the same radii of convergence. Putting the differentiated series into the role of the original series, the original series is now the integrated series and so these would have the same radii of convergence as well. With this in mind, we want to show that if <span class="process-math">\(|x|\lt r\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nnx^{n-1}\)</span> converges. The strategy is to mimic what we did in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_RadiusOfConvergence.html" title="Theorem 11.3.1">TheoremÂ 11.3.1</a>, where we essentially compared our series with a converging geometric series. Only this time we need to start with the differentiated geometric series.</div>
